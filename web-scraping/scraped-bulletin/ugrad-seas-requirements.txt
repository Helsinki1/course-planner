COLUMBIA ENGINEERING UNDERGRADUATE REQUIREMENTS (for all SEAS students)

The First Year/Sophomore Program

Students entering Columbia Engineering are encouraged to consider the wide range of possibilities open to them, both academically and professionally. To this end, the first and second years of the four-year undergraduate program comprise approximately half the total number of credits required for the degree that expose students to a cross-fertilization of ideas from different disciplines within the University. The sequence of study proceeds from an engagement with engineering and scientific fundamentals, along with humanities and social sciences, toward an increasingly focused training in the third and fourth years designed to give students mastery of certain principles and arts central to engineering and applied science.
Liberal Arts Core for Columbia Engineering Students
27-Point Nontechnical Requirement

This requirement provides a broad liberal arts component that enhances the Engineering professional curriculum to help students meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. Our students are destined to be leaders in their professions and will require sophisticated communication, planning, and management skills. The Committee on Instruction established the School’s nontechnical requirement so that students would learn perspectives and principles of the humanities and social sciences as part of a well-rounded and multiperspective education. Through discussion, debate, and writing, students improve their abilities to engage in ethical, analytic, discursive, and imaginative thinking that will prove indispensable later in life.
    Engineering students must take 16 to 18 points of credit of required courses in list A and 9 to 11 elective points chosen from the approved courses in list B. The total combined number of nontechnical points (from lists A and B, below) must add up to at least 27. Neither list can be modified by advising deans or faculty advisers.
    Advanced Placement (AP) credit in appropriate subject areas can be applied toward the 9-point elective nontechnical requirement and for Principles of Economics.
A. required nontechnical courses
(16–18 points of credit)
These courses must be taken at Columbia.
    ENGL CC1010 UNIVERSITY WRITING
    One of the following two-semester sequences: HUMA CC1001 Literature Humanities I-HUMA CC1002 Literature Humanities II: Masterpieces of Western literature and philosophy or COCI CC1101 CONTEMP WESTERN CIVILIZATION I-COCI CC1102 CONTEMP WESTRN CIVILIZATION II: Any two courses from approved list (6–8 points). If electing Global Core, students must take two courses from the List of Approved Courses for a letter grade.Visit bulletin.columbia.edu/columbia-college/core-curriculum/global-core-requirement for more information.
    One of the following two courses:
    HUMA UN1121 Art Humanities,Masterpieces of Western Art or HUMA UN1123 Music Humanities
    ECON UN1105 PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS (This course can be satisfied through Advanced Placement; see the Advanced Placement chart.) Note: Engineering students may not take any Barnard class as a substitute for ECON UN1105 PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS. (4 points)
B. elective nontechnical courses
(9–11 points of credit)
The following course listing by department specifies the Columbia College, Barnard, or Columbia Engineering courses that either fulfill or do not fulfill the nontechnical requirement.
(Professional, workshop, lab, project, scientific, studio, music instruction, and master’s-level professional courses do not satisfy the 27-point nontechnical requirement.)

Music Instruction Courses
Music instruction and performance courses do not count toward the 128 points of credit required for a B.S. degree. Please note that this includes courses taken at Teachers College, Columbia College, and the School of the Arts.
Visual Arts Courses
Students are allowed to take courses in the Visual Arts Department for general credit to be applied toward the B.S. degree. However, no more than one visual arts course, which must be taken at the 3000-level or higher, may count toward the nontechnical elective requirement. This 3000-level course is an exception to the rule that no workshop classes can fulfill the nontech elective requirement.
Technical Course Requirements
The prescribed First-Year/Sophomore Program curriculum requires students to complete a program of technical coursework introducing them to five major areas of technical inquiry: engineering, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer science.
All first-year Engineering undergraduate students take ENGI E1102 THE ART OF ENGINEERING (4 points). In this course, students see how their high school science and math knowledge can be applied in an engineering context to solve real-world problems through classroom presentations and participation in an in-depth, hands-on project. Along the way, guest lecturers discuss social implications of technology, entrepreneurship, project management, and other important nontechnical issues affecting the practicing engineer.
While students need not officially commit to a particular branch of engineering until the third semester, most programs recommend, and in some cases may require, that particular courses be taken earlier for maximum efficiency in program planning. For information concerning these requirements, students should turn to the individual program sections in this bulletin.
Physical Education

Two terms of physical education (PHED UN1001 PHYSICAL EDUCATION ACTIVITIES or PHED UN1002 PHYSICAL EDUCATION ACTIVITIES or PHED UN1003 ) are a degree requirement for Columbia Engineering students. No more than 4 points of physical education courses may be counted toward the degree. The physical education requirement can be fulfilled with Barnard dance studio/technique courses. A student who intends to participate in an intercollegiate sport should register for the appropriate section of PHED UN1005 INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS. Intercollegiate athletes who attend regularly receive 1 point of credit up to a maximum of 4. Student-athletes who leave the team in mid-term but still wish to receive academic credit must notify the Physical Education Office and be placed in another physical education activity to complete the attendance requirement. Students who are advised to follow a restricted or adapted activity program should contact the Director of Physical Education and Recreation. The physical education program offers a variety of activities in the areas of aquatics, fitness, martial arts, individual and dual sports, team sports, and outdoor education. Most activities are designed for the introductory/beginner levels. Intermediate/advanced courses are indicated on the schedule.
Advanced Placement Credit Chart

In order to receive AP credit, students must be in possession of appropriate transcripts or scores and send official score reports to Columbia. The CEEB code is 2116.

    AP credits may be applied toward minor requirements depending on the specific rules of the minor. When the rules of the minor allow AP credit to fulfill a requirement, then only one course for a minor may be replaced by advanced placement credit.
2

    Columbia Engineering students with a 4 or 5 on Calculus AB or a 4 on Calculus BC must begin with MATH UN1101 CALCULUS I  or MATH UN1102 CALCULUS II. If a Columbia Engineering student with these scores goes directly into APMA E2000 MULTV. CALC. FOR ENGI ＆ APP SCI, they will have to go back and complete MATH UN1102 CALCULUS II. Students with A-level or IB calculus credit must start with MATH UN1102 CALCULUS II. They cannot self place into APMA E2000 MULTV. CALC. FOR ENGI ＆ APP SCI. If they start with MATH UN1101 CALCULUS I, they will not receive any advanced standing credit.

The majority of the activities are offered in ten time preferences. Additionally, there are early-morning conditioning activities, Friday-only classes at Baker Athletics Complex, and special courses that utilize off-campus facilities during weekends and vacation periods. The courses offered by the department for each term are included in the online Directory of Classes, and a description of the scheduled activities for each time preference is posted on perec.columbia.edu. Students may only register for one section of physical education each term.
Advanced Placement

Prior to entering Columbia, students may have taken Advanced Placement examinations through the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) in a number of technical and nontechnical areas. A maximum of 16 points may be applied. Students may be assigned to an advanced-level course in mathematics or physics based on their AP scores.

The benefit of advanced placement is acceleration through certain First-Year/Sophomore Program requirements and thus the opportunity of taking specialized courses earlier.

Each year the School reviews the CEEB advanced placement curriculum and makes determinations as to appropriate placements, credit, and/or exemption. Please see the Advanced Placement Credit Chart.
International Baccalaureate (IB)

Entering students may be granted 6 points of credit for each score of 6 or 7 on IB Higher Level Examinations if taken in disciplines offered as undergraduate programs at Columbia. Students should consult their adviser at the James H. and Christine Turk Berick Center for Student Advising for further clarification.
British Advanced Level Examinations

Students with grades of A*, A, or B on British Advanced Level examinations may be granted 6 points of credit if the examinations were taken in disciplines offered as undergraduate programs at Columbia University. The appropriate transcript should be submitted to the James H. and Christine Turk Berick Center for Student Advising, 403 Lerner.
Other National Systems

Students whose secondary school work was in other national systems, such as the French Baccalauréat, may be granted credit in certain disciplines for sufficiently high scores. The appropriate transcript should be submitted to the James H. and Christine Turk Berick Center for Student Advising, 403 Lerner.



The Junior-Senior Programs

Students may review degree progress via DARS (Degree Audit Reporting System) as presented on Student Services Online. Required courses should be completed according to the academic charts in the department sections of the bulletin. Until they are completed, they are listed as deficiencies in the Degree Audit Report. If they are not completed according to the departmental plans, it may be necessary to complete these courses either over the summer or be carried as overload courses in later semesters.

Having chosen their program major in the first semester of their sophomore year, students are assigned to a faculty adviser in the department in which the program is offered. In addition to the courses required by their program, students must continue to satisfy certain distributive requirements, choosing elective courses that provide sufficient content in engineering sciences and engineering design. The order and distribution of the prescribed coursework may be changed with the adviser’s approval. Specific questions concerning course requirements should be addressed to the appropriate department or division.
Double Major

Students who wish to apply for a second major must consult their advising dean about next steps. A proposal to double major must be approved by both departments and then forwarded to the Vice Dean of Academic Programs for a final decision.

Major courses cannot be cross-counted between dual majors. Please consult with an Advising Dean and the respective departmental advisors to find alternative courses for duplicate requirements.

3-2 students are not eligible to have a second major because of the time constraints of their program.  
Tau Beta Pi

Tau Beta Pi is the nation’s second-oldest honor society, founded at Lehigh University in 1885. With the creed “Integrity and excellence in engineering,” it is the only engineering honor society representing the entire engineering profession. Columbia’s chapter, New York Alpha, is the ninth oldest and was founded in 1902. Many Columbia buildings have been named for some of the more prominent chapter alumni: Charles Fredrick Chandler, Michael Idvorsky Pupin, Augustus Schermerhorn, and, of course, Harvey Seeley Mudd.

Undergraduate students whose scholarship places them in the top eighth of their class in their next-to-last year or in the top fifth of their class in their last college year are eligible for membership consideration. These scholastically eligible students are further considered on the basis of personal integrity, breadth of interest both inside and outside engineering, adaptability, and unselfish activity. Benefits of membership include exclusive scholarships and fellowships. Many networking opportunities for jobs and internships are also available, with 230 collegiate chapters and more than 500,000 members in Tau Beta Pi.
Taking Graduate Courses as an Undergraduate Student & Advanced Standing

With the faculty adviser’s approval, a student may take graduate courses while still an undergraduate in the School. Such work may be credited toward one of the graduate degrees offered by the Engineering Faculty, subject to the following conditions:

    the course must be accepted as part of an approved graduate program of study;
    the course must not have been used to fulfill a requirement for the B.S. degree and must be so certified by Engineering Student Affairs; and
    the amount of graduate credit earned by an undergraduate cannot exceed 15 points.

Undergraduates may not take CVN courses.
The Bachelor of Science Degree

Students who complete a four-year sequence of prescribed study are awarded the Bachelor of Science degree. The general requirement for the Bachelor of Science degree is the completion of a minimum of 128 academic credits with a minimum cumulative grade-point average (GPA) of 2.0 (C) at the time of graduation. The program requirements, specified elsewhere in this bulletin, include the first-year/sophomore course requirements, the major departmental requirements, and technical and nontechnical elective requirements. Students who wish to transfer points of credit may count no more than 68 transfer points toward the degree and must satisfy the University’s residence requirements by taking at least 60 points of credit that count for Bachelor of Science Degree while enrolled in The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. Courses may not be repeated for credit unless it is stated otherwise in the course description.

The bachelor’s degree in engineering and applied science earned at Columbia University prepares students to enter a wide range of professions. Students are, however, encouraged to consider graduate work, at least to the master’s degree level, which is increasingly considered necessary for many professional careers.

The Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET, an organization formed by the major engineering professional societies, accredits university engineering programs on a nationwide basis. Completion of an accredited program of study is usually the first step toward a professional engineering license. Advanced study in engineering at a graduate school sometimes presupposes the completion of an accredited program of undergraduate study.

The following undergraduate programs are accredited by the EAC of ABET: biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, earth and environmental engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering.
Minors

Columbia Engineering undergraduates may choose to add minors to their programs. This choice should be made in the fall of their sophomore year, when they also decide on a major.

In considering a minor, students must understand that not all minors are available to all students. Additionally, no class substitutions are permitted when completing a minor. The potential for the successful completion of a minor depends on the student’s major and the minor chosen, as well as the course schedules and availability, which may change from year to year. The list of minors, as well as their requirements, can be found in the Undergraduate Minors section.

Columbia Engineering maintains cooperative program relationships with institutions nationwide and with other Columbia University undergraduate divisions. The Combined Plan programs (3-2 and 4-2) allow students to receive a degree both in the liberal arts and in engineering. Combined Plan students complete the requirements for the liberal arts degree along with required prerequisite coursework for their studies in engineering during the three or four years at their liberal arts college before entering the School of Engineering and Applied Science. They then must complete all the requirements for the B.S. degree within four semesters.
The Combined Plan Program within Columbia University

Under this plan, the pre-engineering student studies in Columbia College, Barnard College, or the School of General Studies for three or four years, then attends The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science for two years, and is awarded the Bachelor of Arts degree and the Bachelor of Science degree in engineering upon completion of the fifth or sixth year. This program is optional at Columbia, but the School recommends it to all students who wish greater enrichment in the liberal arts and pure sciences.
The Combined Plan with Other Affiliated Colleges

There are more than one hundred affiliated liberal arts colleges, including those at Columbia, in which a student can enroll in a Combined Plan program leading to two degrees. Each college requires the completion of a specified curriculum, including major and degree requirements, to qualify for the baccalaureate from that institution. Every affiliated school has a liaison officer who coordinates the program at their home institution. Students interested in this program should inform the liaison officer as early as possible, preferably in the first year, in order to receive guidance about completing program requirements. Applicants from nonaffiliated schools are welcome to apply.

Visit the Undergraduate Admissions website for a complete list of affiliated schools, admission application instructions, information on financial aid, and curriculum requirements for Combined Plan program admission. Please note that no change of major is allowed after an admission decision has been rendered.

For more information, see 4-2 Master of Science Program, BS/MS Program, MS Express Application, and Barnard 4+1 Pathway, which are administered through the Office of Engineering Student Affairs.


Programs in Preparation for Other Professions

The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science prepares its students to enter any number of graduate programs and professions outside of what is generally thought of as the engineering field. In an increasingly technological society, where the line between humanities and technology is becoming blurred, individuals with a thorough grounding in applied sciences and engineering find themselves highly sought after as professionals in practically all fields of endeavor.

Engineering students interested in pursuing graduate work in such areas as architecture, business, education, journalism, or law will find themselves well prepared to meet the generally flexible admissions requirements of most professional schools. Undergraduate students should, however, make careful inquiry into the kinds of specific preparatory work that may be required for admission into highly specialized programs such as medicine.
Premed

Medical, dental, and other health professional schools prefer that undergraduates complete a four-year program of study toward the bachelor's degree. All health professional schools require prerequisite coursework, but they do not prefer one type of major or scholarly concentration. Students with all types of engineering backgrounds are highly valued.

It is important to note, however, that each medical school in the United States and Canada individually determines its own entrance requirements, including prerequisite coursework and/or competencies. Each medical school also sets its own rules regarding acceptable courses or course equivalents. It is therefore essential that students plan early and confirm the premedical requirements for those schools to which they intend to apply. The Engineering curriculum covers many of the prerequisite courses required by medical schools; however, in addition to completing the mathematics, chemistry, and physics courses required by the First-Year/Sophomore Program, most schools ask for a full year of organic chemistry, a full year of biology, a full year of English, a semester of statistics, and a semester of biochemistry. Advanced Placement credit is accepted in fulfillment of these requirements by some schools but not all. Students are responsible for monitoring the requirements of each school to which they intend to apply.

Generally, students with Advanced Placement credit are strongly advised to take further courses in the field in which they have received such credit.

In addition to medical school requirements, all medical schools currently require applicants to sit for the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT). The recommended preparation for this exam is:

    One year of general chemistry and general chemistry lab
    One year of organic chemistry and organic chemistry lab
    One year of introductory biology and biology lab
    One semester of biochemistry
    One year of general physics and physics lab
    One semester of introductory psychology

As you prepare for this path, you should consult regularly with both your assigned adviser and one of the premedical advisers in the James H. Christine Turk Berick Center for Student Advising. These individuals will help to guide you in your course selection and planning, and introduce you to extracurricular and research opportunities related to your interests in health and medicine. Preprofessional Advising maintains an online list of many different clinical volunteer and research opportunities across New York City and beyond. Exploration of the career and sustained interactions with patients is viewed by many medical schools as essential preparation, and therefore students are strongly encouraged to spend time volunteering/working in clinical and research environments before applying to medical school.

Students must apply for admission to health professional schools more than one year in advance of the entry date. Students who are interested in going directly on to health professional schools following graduation should complete all prerequisite courses required for the MCAT by the end of the junior year. It is entirely acceptable (and most common) for students to take time between undergraduate and health professional school and thus delay application to these schools for one or more years. Students planning to apply to medical or dental school should be evaluated by the Premedical Advisory Committee prior to application. A Premedical Advisory Committee application is made available each year in December. For more information regarding this process and other premedical-related questions, please consult with a premedical adviser in the Berick Center for Student Advising or peruse its website at cc-seas.columbia.edu/preprofessional/health.
Prelaw

Students fulfilling the School of Engineering and Applied Science’s curriculum are well prepared to apply to and enter professional schools of law, which generally do not require any specific prelaw coursework. Schools of law encourage undergraduate students to complete a curriculum characterized by rigorous intellectual training involving relational, syntactical, and abstract thinking. While selecting courses, keep in mind the need to hone your writing skills, your communication skills, and your capacity for logical analysis.

While engineering students may find interests in many areas of the law, for intellectual property and patent law, a science and technology background will be greatly valued, if not essential.



Joint Programs
The 4-1 Program at Columbia College

Students who are admitted as first-year students to the School of Engineering and Applied Science and subsequently complete the four-year program for the Bachelor of Science degree have the opportunity to apply for admission to either Columbia College or Barnard College and, after one additional year of study, receive the Bachelor of Arts degree. The fifth year of study begins in the fall semester, and students are required to complete two full-time semesters in the College totaling at least 31 points.

The program is selective, and admission is based on the following factors: granting of the B.S. at Columbia Engineering at the end of the fourth year; fulfillment of all College Core requirements by the end of the fourth year at the School; a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the College Core and other courses; and the successful completion of any prerequisites for the College major or concentration. Students apply at the end of their junior year at the School; to be admitted to the program, students need to have a plan in place to complete the College major or concentration by the end of their fifth year.

The James H. and Christine Turk Berick Center for Student Advising (CSA) guides and supports undergraduates at Columbia College and Columbia Engineering as they navigate their educations and lives at Columbia University. Individually and collaboratively, each advising dean:
    provides individual and group academic advisement and counseling
    provides information on preprofessional studies, major declaration, and progress towards the completion of the degree, as well as various leadership, career, graduate school, and research opportunities
    interprets and disseminates information regarding University policies, procedures, resources, and programs
    educates and empowers students to take responsibility in making informed decisions
    refers students to additional campus resources
Every undergraduate is assigned an adviser from the Berick Center for Student Advising for the duration of their undergraduate career. Generally, each matriculating student is assigned to an advising dean who is a liaison to the department the student indicated as their first intended major on the admissions application. When a student declares a major, a faculty member is also appointed to advise them for the next two years. Depending on their chosen major, students may be assigned to a new advising dean who is a CSA liaison to their department. Advising deans regularly refer students to their academic departments to receive expert advice about their engineering course selections.



STUDY ABROAD
Engineering today is a global profession. Study abroad allows engineering students to discover the field through the perspective of engineers working in a different language and culture, enabling them to learn the relationship of culture to science and develop the range of transferable skills that employers are seeking today. Study abroad will help students develop intellectually, emotionally, culturally, and socially.

Columbia Engineering undergraduate students can study abroad for either a semester (fall, spring, or summer) or, exceptionally, for a full academic year. Students from every engineering major have studied abroad, and most do so in the spring semester of their sophomore year or in their junior year. Although not a requirement, students are encouraged to have some foreign language skills in order to enhance their cultural competency and their overall study abroad experience.

The Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement will help students identify the appropriate choice for their country of interest and their major. Departmental advisers and faculty will help students with their course equivalencies for approved programs so they can graduate on time. Students can take nontechnical electives overseas, or with departmental permission, they may choose technical electives or courses in their major.

It is essential that students begin planning as early as possible. Students are encouraged to meet with advisers in the Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement to review possible global opportunities. Students must obtain approval from their departmental advisers to ensure that their work abroad meets the requirements of their majors, as well as clearance from their Advising Dean in the James H. and Christine Turk Berick Center for Student Advising.

Applied Physics (BS)

    Curriculum
    Degree Track

Undergraduate Program in Applied Physics

The applied physics program stresses the basic physics that underlies most developments in engineering and the mathematical tools that are important to both physicists and engineers. Since the advances in most branches of technology lead to rapid changes in state-of-the-art techniques, the applied physics program provides the student with a broad base of fundamental science and mathematics while retaining the opportunity for specialization through technical electives.
Curriculum

The applied physics curriculum offers students the skills, experience, and preparation necessary for several career options, including opportunities to minor in economics and to take business-related courses. In recent years, applied physics graduates have entered graduate programs in many areas of applied physics or physics, enrolled in medical school, or been employed in various technical or financial areas immediately after receiving the B.S. degree.

Opportunities for undergraduate research exist in the many research programs in applied physics. These include fusion energy and plasma physics, optical and laser physics, and solid state and condensed matter physics. Undergraduate students can receive course credit for research or an independent project with a faculty member. Opportunities also exist for undergraduate students in the applied physics program to participate in this research through part-time employment during the academic year and full-time employment during the summer, either at Columbia or as part of nationwide NSF REU programs. Practical research experience is an important supplement to the formal course of instruction. Applied physics students participate in an informal undergraduate seminar to study current and practical problems in applied physics in both the junior and senior year. They also obtain hands-on experience in at least two advanced laboratory courses.

Majors are introduced to two areas of application of applied physics (AP) by a course in each of two areas. Approved areas and courses are:

Dynamical Systems: APMA E4101 APPL MATH III:DYNAMICAL SYSTMS or PHYS GU4003 ADVANCED MECHANICS

Optical or Laser Physics: APPH E4110 MODERN OPTICS or APPH E4112 LASER PHYSICS or APPH E4114 Quantum and Nonlinear Photonics

Nuclear Science: APPH E4010 INTRODUCTN TO NUCLEAR SCIENCE

Plasma Physics: APPH E4301 INTRO TO PLASMA PHYSICS or APPH E6101 PLASMA PHYSICS I 

Physics of Fluids: APPH E4200 PHYSICS OF FLUIDS or MECE E3100 INTRO TO MECHANCIS OF FLUIDS or APPH E4210 GEOPHYSICAL FLUID DYNAMICS

Solid-State/Condensed Matter Physics: PHYS GU4018 SOLID STATE PHYSICS or MSAE E4200 THEORY CRYSTALLIN MAT: PHONONS

Biophysical Modeling: APMA E4400 INTRO TO BIOPHYSICAL MODELING

In addition to these courses, courses listed in the Elective Specializations in Applied Physics can be used to satisfy this requirement with preapproval of the applied physics adviser.

All students must take 30 points of electives in the third and fourth years, of which 17 points must be technical courses approved by the adviser. The 17 points include 2 points of an advanced laboratory in addition to APPH E4018 APPLIED PHYSICS LABORATORY. Technical electives must be at the 3000 level or above unless prior approval is obtained from the department. A number of approved technical electives are listed in the section on elective specializations. The remaining points of electives are intended primarily as an opportunity to complete the absolutely mandatory four-year, 27-point nontechnical requirement for the B.S. degree, but if this 27-point nontechnical requirement has been met already, then any type of coursework can satisfy these elective points.

Double Major in Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics

Students satisfy all requirements for both majors, except for the seminar requirements. They are required to take both senior seminars, APMA E4903 SEM-PROBLEMS IN APPLIED MATH and APPH E4903 SEM-PROBLMS IN APPLIED PHYSICS (taking one in the junior year and one in the senior year, due to timing conflicts), but not the junior seminars, APMA E4901 SEM-PROBLEMS IN APPLIED MATH and APPH E4901 SEM-PROBLMS IN APPLIED PHYSICS. A single foundational course may be used to fulfill a requirement in both majors. Students must maintain a GPA at or above 3.75, and must graduate with at least 143 points, 15 above the regular 128-point requirement. These extra 15 points should be technical electives appropriate for one or both majors.

To apply, a student first obtains the approval of both the general undergraduate Applied Physics adviser and the general undergraduate Applied Mathematics adviser, and then the approval of the Dean.

Biomedical Engineering (BS)

    Overview
    Curriculum
    Degree Track

The BS Biomedical Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org, under the commission’s General Criteria and Program Criteria for Bioengineering and Biomedical and Similarly Named Engineering Programs. The Program Educational Objectives of the undergraduate program in biomedical engineering are as follows: 

    Professional employment in areas such as the medical device industry, engineering consulting, biomechanics, biomedical imaging, and biotechnology
    Graduate studies in biomedical engineering or related fields;
    Attendance at medical or dental school.

The undergraduate program in biomedical engineering will prepare graduates to achieve the following Student Outcomes:

    an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics
    an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors
    an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences
    an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts
    an ability to function effectively on teams whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives
    an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions
    an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
The undergraduate curriculum is designed to provide broad knowledge of the physical and engineering sciences and their application to the solution of biological and medical problems. Students are strongly encouraged to take courses in the order specified in the course tables; deviations must be discussed with a departmental adviser and approved by the department before registration. The first two years provide a strong grounding in the physical and chemical sciences, engineering fundamentals, mathematics, and modern biology. This background is used to provide a unique physical approach to the study of biological systems. The last two years of the undergraduate program provide substantial exposure to fundamentals in biomedical engineering with emphasis on the integration of principles of biomedical engineering, quantitative analysis of physiology, and experimental quantification and measurements of biomedical systems.

The common core biomedical engineering curriculum provides a broad yet solid foundation in biomedical engineering. The flexible choice of technical electives in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, other departments in the Engineering School, as well as in other departments in the arts and sciences allows students to broaden their biomedical engineering education to their individualized interests for a personalized curriculum. These qualities allow the faculty to prepare students for activity in all contemporary areas of biomedical engineering. Graduates of the program are equipped for employment in the large industrial sector devoted to health care, which includes pharmaceuticals, medical devices, artificial organs, prosthetics and sensory aids, diagnostics, medical instrumentation, and medical imaging. Graduates also accept employment in oversight organizations (FDA, NIH, OSHA, and others), medical centers, and research institutes. They are prepared for graduate study in biomedical engineering and several related areas of engineering and the health sciences. Students can meet entrance requirements for graduate training in the various allied health professions. No more than three additional courses are required to satisfy entrance requirements for most U.S. medical schools.

All biomedical engineering students are expected to register for nontechnical electives, both those specifically required by the School of Engineering and Applied Science and those needed to meet the 27-point total of nontechnical electives required for graduation.
First and Second Years

As outlined in this bulletin, in the first two years, all engineering students are expected to complete a sequence of courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science, engineering, modern biology, English composition, and physical education, as well as nontechnical electives including the humanities. For most of these sequences, the students may choose from two or more tracks. If there is a question regarding the acceptability of a course as a nontechnical elective, please consult the approved listing of courses in Liberal Arts Core for Columbia Engineering 27-Point Nontechnical Requirement or contact your advising dean for clarification.

Please see the charts in this section for a specific description of course requirements.

For students who are interested in the biomedical engineering major, they must take ELEN E1201 INTRO-ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. For the computer science requirement, students must take ENGI E1006 INTRO TO COMP FOR ENG/APP SCI. They must take the two-semester BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I: BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC and BIOL UN2006 INTRO BIO II:CELL BIO,DEV/PHYS in the second year, which gives students a comprehensive overview of modern biology from molecular to organ system levels. In addition, all students must take APMA E2101 INTRO TO APPLIED MATHEMATICS in their second year.
Third and Fourth Years

The biomedical engineering programs at Columbia are based on engineering and biological fundamentals. This is emphasized in our core requirements, which cannot be waived nor substituted. All students must take the two-semester introduction to biomedical engineering courses, BMEN E3010 BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING I and BMEN E3020 BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING II, which provide a broad yet solid foundation in the biomedical engineering discipline. In parallel, all students take the two-semester Quantitative physiology, I and II sequence (BMEN E4001 QUANTITATIVE PHYSIOLOGY I- BMEN E4002 QUANT PHYSIOLOGY II:ORGAN SYST), which is taught by biomedical engineering faculty and emphasizes quantitative applications of engineering principles in understanding biological systems and phenomena from molecular to organ system levels. In the fields of biomedical engineering, experimental techniques and principles are fundamental skills that good biomedical engineers must master. Beginning in junior year, all students take the two-semester sequence Biomedical engineering laboratory, I­­ & II (BMEN E3810 BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING LAB I,  BMEN E3820 BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING LAB II). In this two-semester series, students learn through hands-on experience the principles and methods of biomedical engineering experimentation, measurement techniques, quantitative theories of biomedical engineering, data analysis, and independent design of biomedical engineering experiments, in parallel to the Biomedical engineering I & II and Quantitative physiology I & II courses. In addition, all students must take BMEN E4110 BIOSTATISTICS FOR ENGINEERS. In the senior year, students are required to take a two-semester capstone design course, Biomedical engineering design (BMEN E3910 BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING DESIGN and BMEN E3920 BIOMEDICAL ENGIN DESIGN II), in which students work within a team to tackle an open-ended design project in biomedical engineering. The underlying philosophy of these core requirements is to provide our biomedical engineering students with a broad knowledge and understanding of topics in the field of biomedical engineering.

Parallel to these studies in core courses, students are required to take flexible technical elective courses, which are defined in the following section. The curriculum prepares students who wish to pursue careers in medicine by satisfying most requirements in the premedical programs with no more than three additional courses. Some of these additional courses may also be counted as nonengineering technical electives. Please see the course tables for schedules leading to a bachelor’s degree in biomedical engineering.

It is strongly advised that students take required courses during the specific term that they are designated in the course tables, as scheduling conflicts may arise if courses are taken out of sequence.
Technical Elective Requirements

Technical electives provide in-depth understanding of a student's chosen interests. A technical elective is defined as a 3000-level or above course taught in SEAS or 3000-level or above course in biology, chemistry, biochemistry, or biotechnology. 2000-level organic chemistry and biochemistry courses may also count toward technical electives; please consult your adviser.

Students are required to take 21 points of technical electives. Of these, at least 15 points must be clearly engineering in nature (Engineering Content Technical Electives) as defined below. In addition, at least 6 points of the Engineering Content electives must be from courses in the Department of Biomedical Engineering.

    Engineering Content Technical Electives provide sufficient engineering content to count toward the 48 units of engineering courses required for ABET accreditation and are defined as:

    Courses from the following departments are not allowed to count toward the required 48 units of engineering courses:
        Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics
        Department of Computer Science
        Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research
        Program of Materials Science and Engineering

Once 48 points of engineering content are satisfied, students may choose their remaining technical electives as defined at the beginning of this section.

If a 3000-level or greater course is cross listed between two departments, eligibility as an engineering content technical elective is determined by either of the listed departments in its designation, independent of order. At least one of the programs that are listed must be ABET-accredited to be considered engineering content. For example, APBM E4650 ANATOMY FOR PHYSICISTS ＆ ENGR Anatomy for physicists & engineers and BMCH E4810 ARTIFICAL ORGANS are both engineering content technical electives. Finally, a cross-listed course that is greater than or equal to 3000 level and with BMEN in its call letters will qualify as a BME Engineering Technical Elective.

The accompanying charts describe the eight-semester degree program schedule of courses leading to the bachelor’s degree in biomedical engineering.

The undergraduate Biomedical Engineering program is designed to provide a solid biomedical engineering curriculum through its core requirements while providing flexibility to meet the individualized interests of the students. All students are encouraged to design their own educational paths through technical electives. The following grouped courses provide a useful guide for students who wish to focus their studies in a particular Biomedical Engineering topic. The requirements for these elective concentrations are identical to those of the major’s course requirements. To declare and earn this designation a student must take at least four of the courses listed for that concentration, and at least two of those must be biomedical engineering courses. It is not necessary to declare a concentration for the B.S. program.

To meet entrance requirements of most U.S. medical schools, students will need to take BIOC GU4501 BIOCHEM I-STRUCTURE/METABOLISM (4), CHEM UN2543 ORGANIC CHEMISTRY LABORATORY Organic chemistry laboratory (3), PHYS UN1494 INTRO TO EXPERIMENTAL PHYS-LAB (3), and PSYC UN1001 THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY (3) as well.

Chemical engineering is a highly interdisciplinary field, focused on the study and design of chemical systems from the molecular to the process, system, and global scales. Practicing chemical engineers are in charge of the development and production of diverse materials and processes in traditional chemical industries as well as many emerging new areas. Chemical engineers in industry guide the passage of the product from the laboratory to the marketplace, from ideas and prototypes to functioning articles and processes, from theory to reality. Chemical engineering research is broader still, applying the principles of chemical engineering to the study and design of systems in biochemistry or environmental science, energy, advanced materials, and more.

The expertise of chemical engineers is essential to production, marketing, and application in such areas as renewable energy, pharmaceuticals, high-performance materials in the aerospace and automotive industries, biotechnologies, semiconductors in the electronics industry, paints and plastics, synthetic fibers, artificial organs, biocompatible implants and prosthetics and numerous others. Increasingly, chemical engineers are involved in new technologies employing highly novel materials, whose unusual response at the molecular level endows them with unique properties. Examples include environmental technologies, emerging biotechnologies of major medical importance employing DNA- or protein-based chemical sensors, controlled-release drugs, new agricultural products, nanoparticle-based materials, bio-nanoparticle conjugates, and many others.

Driven by this diversity of applications, chemical engineering is perhaps the broadest of all engineering disciplines, drawing upon physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics and data science, and design. Some of the areas under active investigation are protein engineering, fundamentals and engineering of polymers, biopolymers, and other soft materials, colloidal machines, atmospheric chemistry and air quality, fundamentals and applications of electrochemistry for energy storage and manufacturing, multiphase flows, carbon capture and utilization, catalysis, and electrocatalysis, solar fuels, embryogenesis, the engineering and biochemistry of sequencing the human genome, emergent phenomena in complex and dynamical systems, the biophysics of cellular processes in living organisms, and DNA-guided assembly of inorganic and biological nanoscale objects. Diverse experimental approaches are employed, from NMR, to urban field measurements using sensor networks, to synchrotron techniques, and the theoretical work involves analytical mathematical physics, numerical simulations, and data science.

Interested students will have the opportunity to conduct research in these and other areas. The Department of Chemical Engineering at Columbia is committed to a leadership role in research and education in frontier areas of research and technology where progress derives from the conjunction of many different traditional research disciplines. Increasingly, new technologies and fundamental research questions demand this type of interdisciplinary approach.

The undergraduate program provides a chemical engineering degree that is a passport to many careers in directly related industries as diverse as biochemical engineering, environmental management, and pharmaceuticals. The degree is also used by many students as a springboard from which to launch careers in medicine, law, consulting, management, finance, and so on. For those interested in the fundamentals, a career of research and teaching is a natural continuation of their undergraduate studies. Whichever path the student may choose after graduation, the program offers a deep understanding of the physical and chemical nature of things and provides an insight into new technologies that are rapidly reshaping the society in which we live.
Facilities for Teaching and Research

The Department of Chemical Engineering provides access to state-of-the-art research instrumentation and computational facilities for its undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and faculty. The chemical engineering undergraduate laboratory features equipment including a Waters HPLC system, a SpectraMax spectrophotometer, a rotating disk electrode and potentiostat, a solar cell/electrolyzer/fuel cell apparatus, flow and temperature control equipment, an IR camera, two PhyMetrix Bench-top Moisture Analyzer units, and computer work stations.

State-of-the-art specialized research equipment are housed within individual faculty laboratories. Shared research laboratory facilities exist in the Columbia Electrochemical Energy Center, the Soft Materials laboratory, and the Columbia Genome Center.

Chemical engineering students, faculty, and research staff also have access to shared NMR, MRI, photochemical, spectroscopic, and mass spectrometry facilities in the Department of Chemistry.
The first and sophomore years of study introduce general principles of science and engineering and include a broad range of subjects in the humanities and social sciences. Although the program for all engineering students in these first two years is to some extent similar, there are a few important differences for chemical engineering majors. Those wishing to learn about, or major in, chemical engineering should take the professional elective CHEN E1000 Chemical Engineering for Humanity in term I, taught by the Chemical Engineering Department. This course provides a broad overview of modern chemical engineering. Those wishing to major in chemical engineering should also take ENGI E1006 INTRO TO COMP FOR ENG/APP SCI  in term II. Chemical engineering majors receive additional instruction in CHEN E3020 ANALYSIS OF CHEM ENGIN PROBLMS, and throughout the major core curriculum, on the use of computational methods to solve chemical engineering problems.

The Degree Track table spells out the core course requirements, which are split between courses emphasizing engineering science and those emphasizing practical and/or professional aspects of the discipline. Throughout, skills required of practicing engineers are developed (e.g., writing and presentation skills, competency with computers).

The Degree Track table also shows that a significant fraction of the junior-senior program is reserved for electives, both technical and nontechnical. Twenty-one points (7 courses) of technical electives are included in the junior and senior year requirements. Technical electives are science and/or technology based and feature quantitative analysis. Generally, technical electives must be 3000 level or above but there are a few exceptions including:
Course List
Code 	Title 	Points
PHYS UN1403	INTRO-CLASSCL ＆ QUANTUM WAVES	
PHYS UN2601	PHYSICS III:CLASS/QUANTUM WAVE	
BIOL UN2005	INTRO BIO I: BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC	
BIOL UN2006	INTRO BIO II:CELL BIO,DEV/PHYS	
BIOL UN2501	CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY LAB	
CHEM UN2444	ORGANIC CHEMSTRY II-LECTURES	


A full list of approved technical elective courses in each category can be found on the departmental website or obtained from the departmental advisers. The technical electives are subject to the following constraints:

    1 Thermodynamics Elective: One technical elective must fall within the category “thermodynamics electives”: Chemical engineering courses with 50% or more content related to thermodynamics.  Examples include:
    Course List
    Code 	Title 	Points
    CHAP E4120	STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND COMP METHODS	
    CHEN E4650	POLYMER PHYSICS	
    CHEN E4880	ATOMISTIC SIMULATIONS FOR SCIENCE AND EN	
    1 Transport Elective: One technical elective must fall within the category “transport electives”: Chemical engineering courses with 50% or more content related to transport phenomena (fluid mechanics, heat transfer, or mass transfer). Examples include:
    Course List
    Code 	Title 	Points
    CHEN E4150	COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS I	
    CHEN E4201	ENGIN APPL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY	
    CHEN E4600	AEROSOLS	
    CHEN E4630	TOPICS IN SOFT MATERIALS	

    3 Engineering Technical Electives: Three upper-level SEAS technical courses having significant engineering content. At least one of these three tech electives must have the designators BMCH, CHEN, CHEE, CHAP, or MECH. Qualifying courses are determined by Chemical Engineering advisors.
    2 STEM Technical Electives: The remaining two technical elective courses must comprise "advanced STEM" coursework, which includes the natural sciences, mathematically-oriented SEAS classes, and certain courses based on engineering topics. Qualifying courses are determined by Chemical Engineering department advisors. For a course to count towards this category, these STEM courses must be sufficiently advanced/technical (generally 3000 level or above), but do not necessarily contain engineering content. A limited number of natural science courses (e.g. Chemistry, Physics, Biology) with course number less than 3000 level are approved for this category.

The junior-senior technical electives provide the opportunity to explore new, interesting areas beyond the core requirements of the degree. Often, students satisfy the technical electives by taking courses from another SEAS department in order to obtain a minor from that department. Alternately, you may wish to take courses in several new areas, or perhaps to explore familiar subjects in greater depth, or you may wish to gain experience in actual laboratory research. Up to 6 points of CHEN E3900 UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH PROJECT may be counted toward the technical elective content. (Note that if more than 3 points of research are pursued, an undergraduate thesis is required.)

The undergraduate elective specializations are a way for students to explore a subject area in modern chemical engineering in depth through their selection of technical elective courses. To fulfill an elective specialization, the student must complete any combination of four courses (12 points total) from the list of suggested courses in that subject area. Elective specialization areas are: Climate, Environment, and Energy Solutions; Biotechnology and Biopharmaceuticals; Data and Computational Science; and Advanced Materials. More information on courses satisfying the requirements for each elective specialization can be found on the departmental website.

The program details discussed above apply to undergraduates who are enrolled at Columbia as first-years and declare the chemical engineering major in the sophomore year. However, the chemical engineering program is designed to be readily accessible to participants in any of Columbia’s Combined Plans and to transfer students. In such cases, the guidance of one of the departmental advisers in planning your program is required (contact information for the departmental UG advisers is listed on the department’s website: cheme.columbia.edu).
Elective Specializations

Undergraduate elective specializations allow chemical engineering students to carry out in- depth exploration of a subject area in modern chemical engineering. To fulfill a specialization, the student must complete any combination of four courses (12 points total) from a list of technical elective courses that have been approved by the department to count towards that specialization. Courses taken P/F do not count towards specializations. Four specializations are offered: (i) Advanced Materials, (ii) Biotechnology and Biopharmaceuticals, (iii) Climate, Environment, and Energy Solutions, and (iv.) Data and Computational Science.

Computer Engineering Program

    Overview
    Faculty

Administered by both the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Departments through a joint Computer Engineering Committee.
Student records are kept in the Electrical Engineering Department.

1300 S. W. Mudd, MC 4712
450 Computer Sciences
212-854-3105
compeng.columbia.edu

The computer engineering program is run jointly by the Computer Science and Electrical Engineering departments. It offers both B.S. and M.S. degrees.

The program covers some of engineering’s most active, exciting, and critical areas, which lie at the interface between CS and EE. The focus of the major is on computer systems involving both digital hardware and software.

Some of the key topics covered are computer design (i.e., computer architecture); embedded systems (i.e., the design of dedicated hardware/software for cell phones, automobiles, robots, games, and aerospace); digital and VLSI circuit design; computer networks; design automation (i.e., CAD); and parallel and distributed systems (including architectures, programming, and compilers).

Students in the programs have two “home” departments. The Electrical Engineering Department maintains student records and coordinates advising appointments.

Computer Engineering Program
Technical Electives

The Computer Engineering Program includes 15 points of technical electives. All must be 3000 level or above, technical, and must not have significant overlap with other courses taken for the major. Adviser approval of technical electives is required.

Most courses at the 3000 level or above offered by the Computer Science and Electrical Engineering departments are eligible, and up to two from outside those departments can be considered for approval as well. If a department advertises that one of its courses can be used as a technical elective that does not necessarily mean it will be approved as a technical elective in the computer engineering program. There must be sufficient technical content and computer engineering connection within the entire 15 points, so approval of some courses may depend on the other electives chosen. Economics courses cannot be used as technical electives. COMS W3101 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES/COMS W3102 DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY courses, and not-very-technical courses within the school of engineering, cannot be used as technical electives either.
Starting Early

Students are strongly encouraged to begin taking core computer engineering courses as sophomores. They start with ELEN E1201 INTRO-ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING in the second semester of their first year and may continue with other core courses one semester after that. For sample “early-starting” and “late-starting” programs, see the degree track charts. It must be emphasized that these charts present examples only; actual schedules may be customized in consultation with academic advisers.

    Transfer and combined-plan students are expected to have completed the equivalent of the first- and second-year program listed above before starting their junior year. Note that this includes some background in discrete math (see COMS W3203 DISCRETE MATHEMATICS) and electronic circuits (see ELEN E1201 INTRO-ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING). Transfer and combined-plan students are also expected to be familiar with Java before they start their junior year. If students must take the one-point Java course (COMS W3101 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, COMS W3102 DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY, COMS W3103 ) junior year, prerequisite constraints make it difficult to complete the remaining computer engineering program by the end of the senior year.

Electrical Engineering (BS)

    Overview
    Curriculum
    Degree Track

EE Core Curriculum

All electrical engineering (EE) students must take a set of core courses, which collectively provide the student with fundamental skills, expose them to the breadth of EE, and serve as a springboard for more advanced work, or for work in areas not covered in the core. These courses are shown on the charts in Undergraduate Degree Tracks. A full curriculum checklist is also posted at ee.columbia.edu.
Technical Electives

The 18-point technical elective requirement for the electrical engineering program consists of three components: depth, breadth, and other. A general outline is provided here, and more specific course restrictions can be found at ee.columbia.edu. For any course not clearly listed there, adviser approval is necessary.

The depth component must consist of at least 6 points of electrical engineering courses in one of four defined areas:

    photonics, solid-state devices, and electromagnetics;
    circuits and electronics;
    signals and systems; and
    communications and networking.

The depth requirement provides an opportunity to pursue particular interests and exposure to the process of exploring a discipline in depth—an essential process that can be applied later to other disciplines, if desired.

The breadth component must consist of at least 6 additional points of courses that are outside of the chosen depth area and have significant engineering content. These courses can be from other departments within the School. The breadth requirement precludes overspecialization. Breadth is particularly important today, as innovation requires more and more of an interdisciplinary approach, and exposure to other fields is known to help one’s creativity in one’s own main field. Breadth also reduces the chance of obsolescence as technology changes.

Any remaining technical elective courses, beyond the minimum 12 points of depth and breadth, do not have to be engineering courses (except for students without ELEN E1201 INTRO-ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING or approved transfer credit for ELEN E1201 INTRO-ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING) but must be technical. Generally, math and science courses that do not overlap with courses used to fill other requirements are allowed.

If another department advertises that one of their courses can be used as a technical elective, that does not necessarily mean it will be approved as a technical elective in the electrical engineering program. Which courses are approved depends on other electives chosen due to the depth and breadth restrictions, and the need for sufficient engineering and technical content within the entire 18 points. Electrical engineering technical electives must also be 3000 level or above and must not have significant overlap with other courses taken for the major.
Starting Early

The EE curriculum is designed to allow students to start their study of EE in their first year. This motivates students early and allows them to spread nontechnical requirements more evenly. It also makes evident the need for advanced math and physics concepts, and motivates the study of such concepts. Finally, it allows more time for students to take classes in a chosen depth area, or gives them more time to explore before choosing a depth area. Students can start with ELEN E1201 INTRO-ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING in the second semester of their first year, and can continue with other core courses one semester after that, as shown in the “early-starting students” chart. It is emphasized that both the early- and late-starting sample programs shown in the charts are examples only; schedules may vary depending on student preparation and interests.
Transfer Students

Transfer students coming to Columbia as juniors with sufficient general background can complete all requirements for the B.S. degree in electrical engineering. Such students fall into one of two categories:

Plan 1: Students coming to Columbia without having taken the equivalent of ELEN E1201 INTRO-ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING must take this course in their junior year. This requires postponing the core courses in circuits and electronics until the senior year, and thus does not allow taking electives in that area; thus, such students cannot choose circuits and electronics as a depth area.

Plan 2: This plan is for students who have taken a course equivalent to ELEN E1201 INTRO-ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING at their school of origin, including a laboratory component. Many pre-engineering programs and physics departments at four-year colleges offer such courses. Such students can start taking circuits at Columbia immediately, and thus can choose circuits and electronics as a depth area.

It is stressed that ELEN E1201 INTRO-ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING or its equivalent is a key part of the EE curriculum. The preparation provided by this course is essential for a number of other core courses.

Sample programs for both Plan 1 and Plan 2 transfer students can be found at ee.columbia.edu.

Industrial engineering is the branch of the engineering profession that is concerned with the design, analysis, and control of production and service systems. Originally, an industrial engineer worked in a manufacturing plant and was involved only with the operating efficiency of workers and machines. Today, industrial engineers are more broadly concerned with productivity and all of the technical problems of production management and control. They may be found in every kind of organization: manufacturing, distribution, transportation, mercantile, and service. Their responsibilities range from the design of unit operations to that of controlling complete production and service systems. Their jobs involve the integration of the physical, financial, economic, computer, and human components of such systems to attain specified goals. Industrial engineering includes activities such as production planning and control; quality control; inventory, equipment, warehouse, and materials management; plant layout; and workstation design.

Operations research is concerned with quantitative decision problems, generally involving the allocation and control of limited resources. Such problems arise, for example, in the operations of industrial firms, financial institutions, health care organizations, transportation systems, and government. The operations research analyst develops and uses mathematical and statistical models to help solve these decision problems. Like engineers, they are problem formulators and solvers. Their work requires the formation of a mathematical model of a system and the analysis and prediction of the consequences of alternate modes of operating the system. The analysis may involve mathematical optimization techniques, probabilistic and statistical methods, experiments, and computer simulations.

Management Science and Engineering (also known as Engineering Management Systems) is a multidisciplinary field integrating industrial engineering, operations research, contemporary technology, business, economics, and management. It provides a foundation for decision making and managing risks in complex systems.

Financial engineering is a multidisciplinary field integrating financial theory with economics, methods of engineering, tools of mathematics, and practice of programming. The field provides training in the application of engineering methodologies and quantitative methods to finance.

Business Analytics involves the use of data science tools for solving operational and marketing problems. Students learn to leverage advanced quantitative models, algorithms, and data for making actionable decisions to improve business operations.
Current Research Activities

In industrial engineering, research is conducted in the area of logistics, routing, scheduling, production and supply chain management, inventory control, revenue management, and quality control.

In operations research, new developments are being explored in mathematical programming, combinatorial optimization, stochastic modeling, computational and mathematical finance, queueing theory, reliability, simulation, and both deterministic and stochastic network flows.

In engineering and management systems, research is conducted in the areas of logistics, supply chain optimization, and revenue and risk management.

In financial engineering, research is being carried out in portfolio management; option pricing, including exotic and real options; computational finance, such as Monte Carlo simulation and numerical methods; as well as data mining and risk management.

Projects are sponsored and supported by leading private firms and government agencies. In addition, our students and faculty are involved in the work of four research and educational centers: the Center for Applied Probability (CAP), the Center for Financial Engineering (CFE), the Computational and Optimization Research Center (CORC), and the FDT Center for Intelligent Asset Management.

The Center for Applied Probability (CAP) is a cooperative center involving the School of Engineering and Applied Science, several departments in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and Columbia Business School. Its interests are in four applied areas: mathematical and computational finance, stochastic networks, logistics and distribution, and population dynamics.

The Center for Financial Engineering (CFE) at Columbia University encourages interdisciplinary research in financial engineering and mathematical modeling in finance and promoting collaboration between Columbia faculty and financial institutions, through the organization of research seminars, workshops, and the dissemination of research done by members of the Center.

The Computational Optimization Research Center (CORC) at Columbia University is an interdisciplinary group of researchers from a variety of departments on the Columbia campus. Its permanent members are Professors Daniel Bienstock, Don Goldfarb, Garud Iyengar, Jay Sethuraman, and Cliff Stein, from the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department, and Professor David Bayer, from the Department of Mathematics at Barnard College. Researchers at CORC specialize in the design and implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms for the solution of large-scale optimization problems arising from a wide variety of industrial and commercial applications.

The FDT Center for Intelligent Asset Management is led by Professor Xunyu Zhou at Columbia University. The Center will focus on the exploration of theoretical underpinnings and modeling strategies for financial portfolio management through the introduction of big data analytical techniques. The Center's research will combine modern portfolio theory, behavioral finance, machine learning, and data science to study core problems including optimal asset allocation and risk management; and the research of the Center sits at the crossroads of financial engineering, computer science, statistics, and finance, aiming at providing innovative and intelligent investment solutions.
Industrial Engineering (BS)

    Overview
    Degree Track

The undergraduate program is designed to develop the technical skills and intellectual discipline needed by our graduates to become leaders in industrial engineering and related professions. The program is distinctive in its emphasis on quantitative, economic, computer-aided approaches to production and service management problems. It is focused on providing an experimental and mathematical problem-formulating and problem-solving framework for industrial engineering work. The curriculum provides a broad foundation in the current ideas, models, and methods of industrial engineering. It also includes a substantial component in the humanities and social sciences to help students understand the societal implications of their work.

The industrial engineering program objectives are:

    To provide students with the requisite analytical and computational skills to assess practical situations and academic problems, formulate models of the problems represented or embedded therein, design potential solutions, and evaluate their impact;
    To prepare students for the workplace by fostering their ability to participate in teams, understand and practice interpersonal and organizational behaviors, and communicate their solutions and recommendations effectively through written, oral, and electronic presentations;
    To familiarize students with the historical development of industrial engineering tools and techniques and with the contemporary state of the art, and to instill the need for lifelong learning within their profession; and
    To instill in our students an understanding of ethical issues and professional and managerial responsibilities.

Operations Research (BS)

    Overview
    Degree Track

The operations research program is one of several applied science programs offered at the School. At the undergraduate level, it offers basic courses in probability, statistics, applied mathematics, simulation, and optimization as well as more professionally oriented operations research courses. The curriculum is well suited for students with an aptitude for mathematics applications.

It prepares graduates for professional employment as operations research analysts, e.g., with management consultant and financial service organizations, as well as for graduate studies in operations research or business. It is flexible enough to be adapted to the needs of future medical and law students.

The analytics concentration within the operations research program seeks to train students to leverage advanced quantitative models, algorithms, and data for making actionable decisions to improve business operations. Examples include staffing and scheduling at hospitals, ride matching and pricing for on-demand car services, personalized promotions in online retail, and smarter energy consumption. Students are provided with a rigorous exposure to optimization and stochastic modeling, as well as machine learning and data analysis tools for predictive modeling and prescriptive analytics. Electives in the areas of healthcare, marketing, transportation, deep learning, and many others further enrich students with domain expertise, and provide many opportunities to work directly with data on real-world problems.

This operations research option is designed to provide students with an understanding of contemporary technology and management. It is for students who are interested in a technical-management background rather than one in a traditional engineering field. It consists of required courses in industrial engineering and operations research, economics, business, and computer science, intended to provide a foundation for dealing with engineering and management systems problems. Elective courses are generally intended to provide a substantive core in at least one technology area and at least one management area.

Due to the flexibility of this option, it can incorporate the varied educational needs of preprofessional students interested in law, medicine, business, and finance. In addition, most students are encouraged to add a minor in economics or computer science to their standard course schedules.

The operations research concentration in financial engineering is designed to provide students with an understanding of the application of engineering methodologies and quantitative methods to finance. Financial engineering is a multidisciplinary field integrating financial theory with economics, methods of engineering, tools of mathematics, and practice of programming. Students graduating with this concentration are prepared to enter careers in securities, banking, financial management, and consulting industries, and fill quantitative roles in corporate treasury and finance departments of general manufacturing and service firms.

Students who are interested in pursuing the rigorous concentration in financial engineering must demonstrate proficiency in calculus, computer programming, linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, probability, and statistics.

Materials Science (BS)

    Curriculum
    Degree Track

Undergraduate Program in Material Science

The objectives of the undergraduate program in the Materials Science Program of the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics are as follows:

    Professional employment in industry, including materials production, automotive, aerospace, microelectronics, information storage, medical devices, energy production, storage and conversion, and in engineering consulting firms.
    Graduate studies in materials science and engineering or related fields.

The undergraduate curriculum is designed to provide the basis for developing, improving, and understanding materials and processes for application in engineered systems. It draws from physics, chemistry and other disciplines to provide a coherent background for immediate application in engineering or for subsequent advanced study. The emphasis is on fundamentals relating atomic-to-microscopic-scale phenomena to materials properties and processing, including design and control of industrially important materials processes. Core courses and electives combine rigor with flexibility and provide opportunities for focusing on such areas as nanomaterials, materials for green energy, materials for infrastructure and manufacturing, materials for health and biotechnology, and materials for next generation electronics.

The unifying theme of understanding and interrelating materials synthesis, processing, structure, and properties forms the basis of our program and is evident in the undergraduate curriculum and in faculty research activities. These activities include work on polycrystalline silicon for flat panel displays; semiconductors for lasers and solar cell applications, magnetic heterostructures for information storage and novel computation architectures; electronic ceramics for batteries, gas sensors and fuel cells; electrodeposition and corrosion of metals; and the analysis and design of high-temperature reactors and first principles calculations. Through involvement with our research groups, students gain valuable hands-on experience and are often engaged in joint projects with industrial and government laboratories.

Students are strongly encouraged to take courses in the order specified in the course tables; implications of deviations should be discussed with a departmental adviser before registration. The first two years provide a strong grounding in the physical and chemical sciences, materials fundamentals, and mathematics. This background is used to provide a unique physical approach to the study of materials. The last two years of the undergraduate program provide substantial exposure to modern materials science and include courses in processing, structure and properties of materials that extend the work of the first two years. Graduates of the program are equipped for employment in industry. Graduates are prepared for graduate study in materials science and engineering and related fields.
Required Materials Science Courses

Students are required to take 13 Materials Science courses for a total of 37 points. The required courses are:

Mechanical Engineering

The Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate Program at Columbia University has the following Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) for its graduates:

    Practice mechanical engineering in a broad range of industries.
    Pursue advanced education, research and development, and other creative and innovative efforts in science, engineering, and technology, as well as other professional careers.
    Conduct themselves in a responsible, professional, and ethical manner.
    Participate in activities that support humanity and economic development nationally and globally, developing as leaders in their fields of expertise.

As stated on the Mechanical Engineering department website, graduates of the Mechanical Engineering program at Columbia University will attain the following Student Outcomes:

    an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics
    an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors
    an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences
    an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts
    an ability to function effectively on teams whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives
    an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions
    an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.

Highly qualified students are permitted to pursue an honors course consisting of independent study under the guidance of a member of the faculty.

Upon graduation, the student may wish to enter employment in industry or government, or continue with graduate study. Alternatively, training in mechanical engineering may be viewed as a basis for a career in business, patent law, medicine, or management. Thus, the department’s undergraduate program provides a sound foundation for a variety of professional endeavors.

The BS Mechanical Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org, under the commission’s General Criteria and Program Criteria for Mechanical and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.

Undergraduates who wish to declare mechanical engineering as their major should do so prior to the start of their junior year. Students who declare in their first year should follow the Early Decision Track. Students who declare in their second year should follow the Standard Track. Students who wish to declare during or after the fall semester of their junior year must first obtain approval from the Mechanical Engineering Department.

Of the 18 points of elective content in the third and fourth years, at least 9 points of technical elective courses, including at least 6 points from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, must be taken. A technical elective can be any engineering course offered in the SEAS bulletin that is 3000 level or above. Any course with a description in the Mechanical Engineering section of this bulletin counts as a Mechanical Engineering course. Those prior remaining points of electives are intended primarily as an opportunity to complete the four-year, 27-point nontechnical requirement. Consistent with professional accreditation standards, courses in engineering science and courses in design must have a combined credit of 45 points. Students should see their advisers for details.

Undergraduate students who intend to pursue graduate studies in engineering are strongly encouraged to take the combination of a stand-alone course in linear algebra (either APMA E3101 APPLIED MATH I: LINEAR ALGEBRA or MATH UN2010 LINEAR ALGEBRA) and a stand-alone course in ordinary differential equations (either MATH UN2030 ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS or MATH UN3027 Ordinary Differential Equations), instead of the combined topics course APMA E2101 INTRO TO APPLIED MATHEMATICS. In addition, such students are encouraged to take a course in partial differential equations (APMA E3102 APPLIED MATHEMATICS II: PDE'S or APMA E4200 PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS) as well as a course in numerical methods (APMA E4301 NUMERICAL METHODS/PDE'S, APMA E4302 METHODS IN COMPUTATIONAL SCI, or APMA E4300 COMPUT MATH:INTRO-NUMERCL METH) as technical electives. Ideally, planning for these courses should start at the beginning of the sophomore year.

The FE exam is a state licensing exam and the first step toward becoming a Professional Engineer (P.E.). P.E. licensure is important for engineers to obtain—it shows a demonstrated commitment to professionalism and an established record of abilities that will help a job candidate stand out in the field. Ideally, the FE exam should be taken in the senior year while the technical material learned while pursuing the undergraduate degree is still fresh in the student’s mind. In addition to the FE exam, achieving P.E. licensure requires some years of experience and a second examination, which tests knowledge gained in engineering practice. For more information, please see http://ncees.org/exams/fe-exam.

The Mechanical Engineering Department strongly encourages all seniors to take this exam and offers a review course covering material relevant to the exam, including a practice exam to simulate the testing experience. The FE exam is given in the fall and spring of each year. The review course is offered in the spring semester, concluding before the spring exam.

The Integrated B.S./M.S. degree program is open to a qualified group of Columbia juniors and makes possible the earning of both the B.S. and M.S. degree in an integrated fashion. Benefits of this program include optimal matching of graduate courses with corresponding undergraduate prerequisites, greater ability to plan ahead for most advantageous course planning, opportunities to do research for credit during the summer after senior year, and up to 6 points of 4000-level technical electives from the B.S. requirement may count toward the fulfillment of the point requirement of the M.S. degree. Additional benefits include simplified application process, no GRE is required, and no reference letters are required. To qualify for this program, students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.4 and strong recommendations from within the Department. Students should apply for the program by April 30 in their junior year. For more information on requirements and access to an application form, please visit me.columbia.edu/integrated-bsms-program.

The Express M.S. Application is offered to current seniors, including 3-2 students, who are enrolled in the BS program. In the Express M.S. Application, a master’s degree can be earned seamlessly. Graduate classes are available for seniors to apply toward their M.S. degree and the advanced courses that will be taken have been designed to have the exact prerequisites completed as an undergraduate. Other advantages include the opportunity for better course planning and creating a streamlined set of courses more possible. Additional benefits include simplified application process, no GRE is required and no reference letters are required. To qualify for this program, your cumulative GPA should be at least 3.3. For more information on requirements and access to an application, please visit me.columbia.edu/ms-express-application-1.

The Barnard 4+1 Pathway in Physics is offered to current Barnard College juniors with a GPA of 3.5 or higher to apply to Master's programs in Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Students should inquire with Beyond Barnard and plan on attending an introductory information sessions for the unique 4+1 Pathway they may be interested in pursuing.

    the Computer Science Core (7-8 courses),
    the Area Foundation Courses (4 courses),
    the Computer Science Electives (4 courses),
    and the General Technical Electives (4 courses).
Students are encouraged to work with their faculty adviser to create a plan tailored to fit their goals and interests. The department webpage provides several example programs for students interested in a variety of specific areas in computer science.
Note: All courses toward the CS major must be taken for a letter grade. A maximum of one course worth no more than 4 points passed with a grade of D may be counted toward the major.
Prerequisite to the CS Major: ENGI E1006 INTRO TO COMP FOR ENG/APP SCI. All CS majors should take this course in their first or second semester. However, students may opt out of this course while still fulfilling the requirement if they speak with the professor and demonstrate sufficient prior knowledge.

BELOW ARE REQUIREMENTS FOR MINORS (minor degrees, not majors)

Undergraduate Minors

    Overview
    Minors

Undergraduate minors are designed to allow engineering and applied science students to study, to a limited extent, a discipline other than their major. Besides engineering minors offered by Columbia Engineering departments, liberal arts minors are also available.

A minor requires at least 15 points of credit, and no more than one course can be taken outside of Columbia or met through AP or IB credit. This includes courses taken through study abroad. In Engineering departments with more than one major program, a minor in the second program may be permitted, if approved by the department.

No substitutions or changes of any kind from the approved minors are permitted (see lists below). No appeal for changes will be granted. Please note that the same courses may not be used to satisfy the requirements of more than one minor. No courses taken for pass/fail may be counted for a minor. Minimum GPA for the minor is 2.0. Departments outside the Engineering School have no responsibility for nonengineering minors offered by Engineering.

For a student to receive credit for a course taken while studying abroad, the department offering the minor must approve the course in writing, ahead of the student’s study abroad.

Students must expect a course load that is heavier than usual. In addition, unforeseen course scheduling changes, problems, and conflicts may occur. The School cannot guarantee a satisfactory completion of the minor.

    Students with higher level of language proficiency have three options:

        Students who test out of CATL UN2102 INTERMEDIATE CATALAN II may take the equivalent of two semesters of another language course at the introductory level OR one semester of an intermediate language course in another language taught in the Latin American or Iberian Department (ex: Portuguese, Spanish). The goal is to achieve reading proficiency.
        Students who test out of CATL UN2102 INTERMEDIATE CATALAN II and have not chosen #1 (Catalan or Spanish language classes) can count two Columbia courses related to Latin American and Iberian Cultures content outside of LAIC at the 3000+ OR two study abroad courses, subject to approval by the Director of Undergraduate Studies (classes should have a clear Catalan focus). Note the opportunity to count two non-LAIC (vs. one for Portuguese and Spanish) or two study abroad courses for Catalan (vs. two for Portuguese and one for Spanish), which rewards students for studying abroad in Catalan-speaking places.
