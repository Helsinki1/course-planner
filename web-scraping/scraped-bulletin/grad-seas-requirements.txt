Graduate Programs

Graduate programs of study in The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science are not formally prescribed, but are planned to meet the particular needs and interests of each individual student. Departmental requirements for each degree, which supplement the general requirements given below, appear in the sections on individual graduate programs.

Applicants for a graduate program are required to have completed an undergraduate degree and to provide an official transcript as part of the admissions application. Ordinarily, the candidate for a graduate degree will have completed an undergraduate course in the same field of engineering in which they seek a graduate degree. However, if the student’s interests have changed, it may be necessary to make up such basic undergraduate courses as are essential to graduate study in their new field of interest.

A maximum of 15 points of credit of graduate-level coursework completed at Columbia University, before the new program is approved and not used toward another degree, may be counted toward the degree. Students registered in the School have a minimum requirement for each Columbia degree of 30 points of credit of coursework completed at Columbia University. The student must enroll for at least 15 of these points while registered as a matriculating student in a degree program in the Engineering School. (See also the section Nondegree Students and the chapter Columbia Video Network.) Students wishing to change from the Ph.D. degree to the Eng.Sc.D. degree must therefore enroll for at least 15 points while registered in the School. For residence requirements for students registered in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences or those wishing to change from the Eng.Sc.D. degree to the Ph.D. degree, see the bulletin of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

Students admitted to graduate study are expected to enter upon the term for which they are admitted and continue their studies in each succeeding regular term of the academic year. Any student who fails to register for the following term will be withdrawn unless a leave of absence has been granted by the Office of Engineering Student Affairs.

While many candidates study on a full-time basis, it is usually possible to obtain all or a substantial part of the credit requirement for the master’s or Eng.Sc.D. degrees through part-time study.

Under special conditions, and with the prior approval of the department of their major interest and of the Assistant Dean, a student may be permitted to take a required subject at another school. However, credit for such courses will not reduce the 30-point minimum that must be taken at Columbia University.

For graduation, a candidate for any degree except a doctoral degree must file an Application for Degree or Certificate on the date specified on the Registrar's website. Candidates for a doctoral degree must apply for the final examination. If the degree is not earned by the next regular time for the issuance of diplomas subsequent to the date of filing, the application must be renewed. Degrees are awarded three times a year—in October, February, and May.

 The Office of Engineering Student Affairs at The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science is integral to the School’s teaching, research, and service mission and works to enhance the educational opportunities available to students. This office provides leadership for the integration of educational programs and services that enhance recruitment, retention, and quality of campus life for graduate students at Columbia Engineering. It strives to demonstrate sensitivity and concern in addressing the needs of the School’s population. The office is dedicated to providing service to prospective, new, and continuing students pursuing a graduate education in engineering or applied science. 

Master of Science Degree

The Master of Science degree is offered in many fields of engineering and applied science upon the satisfactory completion of a minimum of 30 points of credit of approved graduate study extending over at least one academic year.

While a suitable Master of Science program will necessarily emphasize some specialization, the program should be well balanced, including basic subjects of broad importance as well as theory and applications. The history of modern economic, social, and political institutions is important in engineering, and this is recognized in the prescribed undergraduate program of the School. If the candidate’s undergraduate education has been largely confined to pure science and technology, a program of general studies, totaling from 6 to 8 points, may be required. Supplementary statements covering these special requirements are issued by the School’s separate departments. An applicant who lacks essential training will be required to strengthen or supplement the undergraduate work by taking or repeating certain undergraduate courses before proceeding to graduate study. No graduate credit (that is, credit toward the minimum 30-point requirement for the Master of Science degree) will be allowed for such subjects. Accordingly, Master of Science programs may include from 35 to 45 points and may require three terms for completion. Doctoral research credits cannot be used toward M.S. degree requirements.

All degree requirements must be completed within five years of the beginning of graduate study. Under extraordinary circumstances, a written request for an extension of this time limit may be submitted to the student’s department for approval by the department chair and the Assistant Dean. A minimum cumulative grade-point average of 2.5 is required for the M.S. degree. A student who, at the end of any term, has not attained the grade-point average required for the degree may be asked to withdraw.

An M.S. student may submit an application to apply and transfer to another academic program but cannot transfer earlier than the first semester of enrollment. If the student is not successful with the application process, then they must make sure requirements for the original academic program are completed.
Professional Development Leadership M.S. Requirement

(ENGI E4000 PROF DEVELOPMENT＆LEADERSHIP)

The Professional Development and Leadership (PDL) program educates students to maximize performance and achieve their full potential to become engineering leaders. The core modules focus on development of professional skills and perspectives needed to succeed in a fast-changing technical climate.

M.S. students must complete the professional development and leadership course, ENGI E4000 PROF DEVELOPMENT＆LEADERSHIP, as a graduation requirement. This course is expected to be completed during the first two semesters of enrollment.
Professional Development Leadership Doctoral Requirement

(ENGI E6001 Professional development and leadership for first year doctoral students–ENGI E6004 Professional development and leadership for fourth year doctoral students)

The Professional Development and Leadership (PDL) program educates students to maximize performance and achieve their full potential during and after the doctoral program. The goal is to cultivate future scholars and leaders in their respective fields. The modules are tailored for each stage of the doctoral program, with a focus on the development of academic, research, and professional skills. Students will also have the opportunity to participate in small group communication workshops for doctoral students and individualized coaching tailored to their specific goals. Doctoral students will be enrolled in ENGI E6001 Professional development and leadership for first year doctoral students–ENGI E6004 Professional development and leadership for fourth year doctoral students and should consult their program for specific PDL requirements.
Executive Master of Science in Engineering and Applied Science

Offered by Columbia Engineering, the Executive Master of Science in Engineering and Applied Science will provide students with a broad understanding of engineering science and the end-to-end product development process. It is intended for professionals who are preparing for leadership roles that need an understanding of the development process of new products (goods or services). Candidates for the Executive Master of Science in Engineering and Applied Science are required to complete a minimum of 30 graduate-level credits, which includes core courses (15 credits), electives in their concentration (12 credits in one concentration), and a capstone project that integrates their overall learning experience and prepares them to take on a significant leadership role (3 credits). M.S. students must complete the professional development and leadership course, ENGI E4000 PROF DEVELOPMENT＆LEADERSHIP, as a graduation requirement.
The 4-2 Master of Science Program

The 4-2 Master of Science Program provides the opportunity for students holding bachelor’s degrees from affiliated liberal arts colleges (see the listing under the heading The Combined Plan Program with Other Affiliate Colleges) with majors in mathematics, physics, chemistry, or certain other physical sciences to receive the M.S. degree after two years of study at Columbia in the following fields of engineering and applied science: biomedical, chemical, civil, earth and environmental, electrical, industrial, and mechanical engineering; applied physics; applied mathematics; computer science; engineering mechanics; operations research; and materials science.

Each applicant must produce evidence of an outstanding undergraduate record, including superior performance in physics and mathematics through differential equations. The program of study will be individually designed in consultation with a faculty adviser and will integrate undergraduate work with the field of engineering or applied science the student chooses to follow. During the first year, the program will consist primarily of basic undergraduate courses; during the second year, of graduate courses in the selected field. The student must complete at least 30 credits of graduate study to qualify for the degree.

A student whose background may require supplementary preparation in some specific area, or who has been out of school for a considerable period, will have to carry a heavier than normal course load or extend the program beyond two years.

Graduates of the 4-2 Master of Science program may not be eligible to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam if their undergraduate degree is not in engineering or a related field. Students should also check with individual state boards to determine eligibility requirements for employment.

Please contact the Office of Engineering Student Affairs. You should also contact your home institution’s Combined Plan liaison for program information. You may, in addition, email questions to seasgradmit@columbia.edu.

Doctoral Degrees: Eng.Sc.D. and Ph.D.

Two doctoral degrees in engineering are offered by the University: the Doctor of Engineering Science, administered by The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the Doctor of Philosophy, administered by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Both doctoral programs are subject to review by the Committee on Instruction of the School. Doctoral students may submit a petition to the Office of Engineering Student Affairs to change from the Eng.Sc.D. degree to the Ph.D. degree or from the Ph.D. degree to the Eng.Sc.D. degree. The petition must be submitted within the first year of enrollment in the doctoral program. Any petitions submitted after this period will not be considered. Doctoral degree status can be changed only once; students, therefore, must determine which doctoral degree program is most appropriate for their academic and professional endeavors.

Departmental requirements may include comprehensive written and oral qualifying examinations. A student must have a satisfactory grade-point average to be admitted to the doctoral qualifying examination. Thereafter, the student must write a dissertation embodying original research under the sponsorship of a member of their department and submit it to the department. If the department recommends the dissertation for defense, the student applies for final examination, which is held before an examining committee approved by the appropriate Dean’s Office. This application must be made at least three weeks before the date of the final examination.

The defense of the dissertation constitutes the final test of the candidate’s qualifications. It must be demonstrated that the candidate has made a contribution to knowledge in a chosen area. In content, the dissertation should, therefore, be a distinctly original contribution in the selected field of study. In form it must show the mastery of written English, which is expected of a university graduate.
For the Ph.D. Degree

A student must obtain the master’s degree (M.S.) before enrolling as a candidate for the Ph.D. degree. Application for admission as a doctoral candidate may be made while a student is enrolled as a master’s degree candidate. Candidates for the Ph.D. degree must register full time and complete six Residence Units. The minimum requirement in coursework for the doctoral degree is 60 points of credit beyond the bachelor’s degree. A master’s degree from an accredited institution may be accepted in the form of advanced standing as the equivalent of one year of residence (30 points of credit and two Residence Units). An application for advanced standing must be completed during the first semester of study. Ph.D. candidates will be required to complete a minimum of 30 additional points of credit in residence for a letter grade beyond the M.S. 

Ph.D. candidates who have completed all six Residence Units can satisfy the continuous registration requirement and make use of various University facilities by registering for Matriculation & Facilities (M&F) for a maximum of two semesters if they are:

    completing a degree requirement such as a language examination or qualifying examination;
    preparing the dissertation proposal; or
    writing or distributing the dissertation.

If a Ph.D. student is registered in courses or holds a university teaching or research appointment, the student must register for either a full Residence Unit or Extended Residence.

Ph.D. students must be registered for the semester in which their distribution takes place. The term in which the dissertation distribution occurs is the last semester in which a Ph.D. student is permitted to register, even if the defense takes place in a subsequent term. Click here for more detailed information about final registration requirements. Students should also be aware that International Students with questions about their registration and remaining in visa compliance should contact the International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO). 

Note: Full-time doctoral students who are supported on faculty grants through twelve-month research appointments should pay particular attention to the special conditions that are noted on the Registration and Application for PhD Defense page. 

    Distribution deadlines can be found here. 
    Dates for the fall and spring terms can be found on the Registrar's Academic Calendar. 
    Dates for the summer term can be found on the School of Professional Studies website.
    Students covered under the Columbia Student Health Insurance Plan are strongly advised to review the information regarding the plan's coverage periods and important dates. Students with specific questions regarding their insurance coverage should contact the Columbia Health Insurance Office at studentinsurance@columbia.edu.
    Similarly, students with active Columbia Residential leases should review the policy regarding dissertation defenses and housing eligibility. 

Students should distribute final copies of the dissertation to defense committee members at least four weeks before the anticipated defense date to allow adequate time for committee members to review the dissertation thoroughly. The defense is expected to take place no later than two months after the distribution.

Ph.D. candidates should obtain a copy of the bulletin of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, in which are printed the requirements of the department of major interest.
For the Eng.Sc.D. Degree

A student must obtain the master’s degree (M.S.) before enrolling as a candidate for the Doctor of Engineering Science (DES) degree. The minimum requirement in coursework for the doctoral degree is 60 points of credit beyond the bachelor’s degree. Eng.Sc.D. candidates will be required to complete a minimum of 30 additional points of credit in residence beyond the M.S. for a letter grade. A master’s degree from an accredited institution may be accepted in the form of advanced standing as the equivalent of 30 points of credit. Candidates for the Eng.Sc.D. degree must, in addition to the 60-point requirement, accumulate 12 points of credit in the departmental course E9800: Doctoral research instruction (see below). The candidate for the degree of Doctor of Engineering Science must submit evidence that their dissertation has been filed in compliance with requirements set by the faculty of Engineering and Applied Science.
Doctoral Research Instruction

An Eng.Sc.D. candidate is required to complete 12 credits in the departmental course E9800: Doctoral research instruction in accordance with the following guidelines:

    After obtaining a master’s degree or advanced standing, at which time the student begins doctoral research, the student is eligible to register for E9800 (3, 6, 9, or 12 points of credit per term).
    Registration for E9800 at a time other than that prescribed above is not permitted, except by written permission of the Dean.
    The 12 points of E9800 required for the Eng.Sc.D. degree do not count toward the minimum residence requirements, e.g., 30 points beyond the master’s degree or 60 points beyond the bachelor’s degree.
    If a student is required to take coursework beyond the minimum residence requirements, the 12 points of doctoral research instruction must still be taken in addition to the required coursework.
    A student must register continuously through the fall and the spring terms. This requirement does not include the summer session.

Completion of Requirements

The requirements for the Eng.Sc.D. degree must be completed in no more than seven years. The seven-year time period begins at the time of enrollment and extends to the date on which the dissertation defense is held.

Extension of the time allowed for completion of the degree may be granted on recommendation of the student’s sponsor and the department chair to the Office of Engineering Student Affairs when special circumstances warrant. Such extensions are initiated by submitting a statement of work in progress and a schedule for completion together with the sponsor’s recommendation to the department chair.

Please contact the Office of Engineering Student Affairs for more information.

Nondegree Students

Qualified persons who are not interested in a degree program but who wish only to take certain courses may be permitted to register as nondegree students, provided course capacity allows and instructor permission is obtained.

Many graduate courses in The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science are offered in the late afternoon and evening in order to make them available to working individuals who wish to further their knowledge in the areas of engineering and applied science. Individuals who find it difficult or impossible to attend classes on the Columbia campus may be able to receive instruction from the School through the Columbia Video Network without leaving their worksites. Individuals interested in this program should read the section describing the distance learning Columbia Video Network (CVN), which follows in the bulletin.

Nondegree students receive grades and must maintain satisfactory attendance and performance in classes or laboratories and will be subject to the same rules as degree candidates. Should a nondegree student decide to pursue a degree program, work completed as a nondegree student may be considered for advanced standing, but no more than 15 points of coursework completed as a nondegree student may be counted toward a graduate degree.

For additional information and regulations pertaining to nondegree students, see Graduate Admissions.

The basic requirement for admission as a graduate student is a bachelor’s degree received from an institution of acceptable standing. Ordinarily, the applicant will have majored in the field in which graduate study is intended, but in certain programs, preparation in a related field of engineering or science is acceptable. The applicant will be admitted only if the undergraduate record shows promise of productive and effective graduate work.

Students who hold an appropriate degree in engineering may apply for admission to study for the Ph.D. degree. However, students are required to obtain the master’s degree first. Students currently enrolled in the School's M.S. program may apply for admission to the doctoral program after completing 15 points of coursework. Completion of a relevant master's degree is required prior to entry into the Ph.D. program.

Students may be admitted in one of the following five classifications:

    candidate for the M.S. degree,
    candidate for the M.S. degree leading to the Ph.D. degree,
    candidate for the Doctor of Engineering Science degree,
    candidate for the Doctor of Philosophy degree (see also the bulletin of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences), or
    nondegree student (not a degree candidate).

Note: No more than 15 points of credit completed as a nondegree student may be counted toward a degree.

The applicant must submit all materials directly, not through an agent or third-party vendor, with the sole exception of submissions by the U.S. Department of State's Fulbright Program and its three partner agencies: IIE, LASPAU and AMIDEAST, and by the Danish-American Fulbright Commission (DAF), Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD), and Vietnam Education Fund (VEF). In addition, the applicant will be required to attest to the accuracy and authenticity of all information and documents submitted to Columbia. If you have any questions about this requirement, please contact the admissions office at seasgradmit@columbia.edu.

Academic integrity is the cornerstone of a university education. Failure to submit complete, accurate, and authentic application documents consistent with these instructions may result in denial or revocation of admission, cancellation of academic credit, suspension, expulsion, or eventual revocation of degree. Applicants may be required to assist admissions staff and faculty involved in admission reviews in the verification of all documents and statements made in documents submitted by students as part of the application review process.
Application Requirements

Applicants can only apply to one degree program per admission term. Applicants must submit an online application and required supplemental materials, as described below. An official transcript from each postsecondary institution attended, personal statement, and resume or curriculum vitae must be submitted. Consideration for admission will be based not only on the completion of an earlier course of study, but also upon the quality of the record presented and upon such evidence as can be obtained concerning the applicant’s personal fitness to pursue professional work.

Additionally, applicants must provide three letters of recommendation and the results of required standardized exams. If you have taken the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and would like to provide your scores, you may, but it is not required. Students who do not submit scores will not be penalized in the graduate admissions review process. Students who do submit scores will be required to submit official test scores should they be admitted. Students applying to the Applied Physics Ph.D. or Applied Physics MS/Ph.D. Track program may supply GRE Physics subject test scores, although it is not required. GRE general and subject test scores are valid for five years from the test administration date according to the Educational Testing Service (ETS). English language test scores are required of all applicants who received their bachelor's degree in a country in which English is not the official and widely spoken language. The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), International English Language Testing System (IELTS), Duolingo English Test (DET), or Pearson Test of English (PTE) scores satisfy the test requirement and are valid for two years according to the test organizations.

Applicants may be asked to participate in an interview as part of the application process.
English Proficiency

The Office of Engineering Student Affairs no longer requires students to demonstrate English proficiency as a graduation requirement at The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. Regardless of TOEFL, IELTS, DET, or PTE scores submitted for admission, students should continue to work on maintaining adequate verbal and/or written abilities for successful integration within their classes and future professional endeavors. Students are highly encouraged to be proactive about addressing their English proficiency by utilizing the many resources available within Columbia University and throughout New York City.

Students have the option of enrolling in communication courses offered through Columbia Engineering's Professional Development and Leadership courses (noncredit, tuition-free) and the American Language Program (ALP) at Columbia University (credited). Course credits earned through ALP, however, do not count toward the minimum engineering academic coursework requirements. Enrollment in ALP courses is solely the financial responsibility of the student. As a rule, ISSO will not permit students to drop courses or fall below full-time registration for language proficiency deficiencies.
Application Fee

The nonrefundable application fee for all graduate degree and nondegree programs is $85.
Graduate Admission Calendar

Applicants are admitted twice yearly, for the fall and spring semesters.

    Fall admission application deadlines: December 15 for Ph.D., Eng.Sc.D., and M.S. leading to Ph.D. programs and February 15 for most M.S. only and nondegree applicants. Please visit the Office of Engineering Student Affairs website for specific M.S. only program deadlines.
    Spring admission application deadline: October 1 for all departments and degree levels.

Applicants who wish to be considered for scholarships, fellowships, and assistantships should file complete applications for fall admission.
Express Application

Columbia Engineering, Columbia College, General Studies, and Barnard seniors as well as alumni from the same schools, who have graduated within three years, may be eligible to apply to a master's program using the express application process. A minimum cumulative GPA of 3.3 in an approved undergraduate program is required to be eligible to submit an M.S. Express application. For more information about eligibility, visit the Office of Engineering Student Affairs website.

BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
Graduate Programs

    Overview
    Programs

The graduate curriculum in biomedical engineering is track-free. Initial graduate study in biomedical engineering is designed to expand the student’s undergraduate preparation in the direction of the concentration of interest. In addition, sufficient knowledge is acquired in other areas to facilitate broad appreciation of problems and effective collaboration with specialists from other scientific, medical, and engineering disciplines. The Department of Biomedical Engineering offers a graduate program leading to the Master of Science degree (M.S.), the Doctor of Philosophy degree (Ph.D.), and the Doctor of Engineering Science degree (Eng.Sc.D.). Applicants who have a Master of Science degree or equivalent may apply directly to the doctoral degree program. All applicants are expected to have earned the bachelor’s degree in engineering or in a cognate scientific program. The Graduate Record Examination (General Test only) is optional for all applicants. Students whose bachelor’s degree was not earned in a country where English is the dominant spoken language are required to take the TOEFL, IELTS, PTE Academic, or Duolingo English Test.

Columbia Engineering does not admit students holding the bachelor’s degree directly to doctoral studies; admission is offered either to the M.S. program or to the M.S. program/doctoral track. The Department of Biomedical Engineering also admits students into the 4-2 program, which provides the opportunity for students holding a bachelor’s degree from certain physical sciences to receive the M.S. degree after two years of study at Columbia.

M.S. students must complete the professional development and leadership course, ENGI E4000 PROF DEVELOPMENT＆LEADERSHIP, as a graduation requirement. Doctoral students will be enrolled in ENGI E6001 Professional development and leadership for first year doctoral students–ENGI E6004 Professional development and leadership for fourth year doctoral students and should consult their program for specific PDL requirements.
Biomedical Engineering (MS)
Master’s Degree

In consultation with an appointed faculty adviser, M.S. students should select a program of 30 points of credit of graduate courses (4000-level or above) appropriate to their career goals. This program must include the course in computational modeling of physiological systems (BMEN E6003 COMP MODELING-PHYSIOL SYSTEMS); two semesters of BMEN E9700 BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING SEMINAR; at least four other biomedical engineering courses where BM is in its call letters; and at least one graduate-level course (at least 3 credits) either in the departments of Applied Mathematics or Statistics or BMEN E4110 BIOSTATISTICS FOR ENGINEERS. Up to 6 credits of BMEN E9100 MASTERS RESEARCH may be taken to fulfill degree requirements. Up to 3 credits of coursework outside of SEAS may count toward the MS degree. Students with deficiency in physiology coursework are advised to take the BMEN E4001 QUANTITATIVE PHYSIOLOGY I-BMEN E4002 QUANT PHYSIOLOGY II:ORGAN SYST sequence before taking BMEN E6003 COMP MODELING-PHYSIOL SYSTEMS. Candidates must achieve a minimum grade-point average of 2.5. A thesis based on experimental, computational, or analytical research is optional. Students wishing to pursue the Master’s Thesis option are required to complete 5-6 credits of BMEN E9100 MASTERS RESEARCH and consult with their BME faculty adviser to register for BMEN E9200. 

MS concentrations are not required. The following grouped courses are a useful guide for students who wish to focus their studies in a particular Biomedical Engineering topic. If a student chooses to declare a concentration, the requirements for these elective concentrations are identical to those of the standard track (including BMEN E6003 COMP MODELING-PHYSIOL SYSTEMS, Applied Math / Statistics / BMEN E4110 BIOSTATISTICS FOR ENGINEERS, BMEN E9700 BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING SEMINAR, four BMEN courses, and three or more SEAS courses, comprising at least 27 credits in SEAS out of a total 30 required credits), with one exception: students must take at least 12 credits from a list of track-specific courses.

Biomedical Engineering (PhD)
Doctoral Degree

Doctoral students must complete a program of 30 points of credit beyond the M.S. degree. The core course requirements (9 credits) for the doctoral program include the course in computational modeling of physiological systems (BMEN E6003 COMP MODELING-PHYSIOL SYSTEMS), plus at least two graduate-level courses (at least 6 credits) either in the departments of Applied Mathematics or Statistics or BMEN E4110 BIOSTATISTICS FOR ENGINEERS. If BMEN E6003 COMP MODELING-PHYSIOL SYSTEMS has already been taken for the master’s degree, a technical elective can be used to complete the core course requirement. If one or both graduate-level applied mathematics courses have been taken for the master's degree, technical elective(s) can be used as a substitution. Students must register for BMEN E9700 BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING SEMINAR and for research credits during the first two semesters of doctoral study. Remaining courses should be selected in consultation with the student’s faculty adviser to prepare for the doctoral qualifying examination and to develop expertise in a clearly identified area of biomedical engineering. Students should not receive more than two "C" or below letter grades.

All graduate students admitted to the doctoral degree program must satisfy the equivalent of two semesters’ experience in teaching (one semester for M.D./Ph.D. students). This may include supervising and assisting undergraduate students in laboratory experiments, grading, and preparing lecture materials to support the teaching mission of the department. The requirement must be completed by the 3rd year of graduate studies. The Department of Biomedical Engineering is the only engineering department that offers Ph.D. training to M.D./Ph.D. students. These candidates are expected to complete their Ph.D. program within 3.5 years, with otherwise the same requirements as those outlined for the Doctoral Degree program.
Doctoral Qualifying Examination

Doctoral candidates are required to pass a qualifying examination. This examination is given once a year, and it should be taken after the student has completed 30 points of graduate study. The qualifying examination consists of an oral exam during which the student presents an analysis of assigned scientific papers, as well as answers to questions in topics covering applied mathematics, quantitative biology and physiology, and material. The committee consists of the thesis adviser and two BME core faculty members approved by the graduate studies committee. A written analysis of the assigned scientific papers must be submitted prior to the oral exam. A minimum cumulative grade-point average of 3.2 without research credit grades is required to register for this examination.
Doctoral Committee and Thesis

Students who pass the qualifying examination must have a core BME faculty member who will serve as their primary research adviser or co-adviser. Each student is expected to submit a research proposal and present it to a committee that consists of three BME faculty members (two must be core BME faculty members, including research adviser) before the end of year 4. The committee considers the scope of the proposed research, its suitability for doctoral research and the appropriateness of the research plan. The committee may approve the proposal without reservation or may recommend modifications. In general, the student is expected to submit their research proposal after five semesters of doctoral studies. In accordance with regulations of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, each student is expected to submit a thesis and defend it before a committee of five faculty, one of whom holds primary appointment in another department or school or university. Every doctoral candidate is required to have had at least one first-author full-length paper accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal prior to recommendation for award of the degree.
Biomedical Engineering (MD/MS)
Dual Degree Program
M.D./M.S. Program in Biomedical Engineering

The Doctor of Medicine/Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering (M.D./M.S.) program is an integrated program offered between The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science and the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. The purpose of this program is to supplement the current training of medical students with world-class training in biomedical engineering at the graduate level. This interdisciplinary educational experience will prepare students to become innovative leaders in science, engineering, and medicine. Application to the program is restricted to enrolled Columbia medical students.  It makes possible the earning of both the M.D. and M.S. degree in 5 years (4 years for the M.D. program, 1 year for the M.S. program). Six points from the M.D. degree, through completion of anatomy coursework, will also count toward the Master of Science degree. Students must first be admitted to the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University and then apply separately to the Department of Biomedical Engineering. For more information on requirements and application process, please visit bme.columbia.edu.


CHEMICAL ENGINEERING

    Overview
    Programs

The graduate program in chemical engineering, with its large proportion of elective courses and independent research, offers experience in any of the fields of departmental activity mentioned in previous sections. For both chemical engineers and those with undergraduate educations in other related fields such as physics, chemistry, and biochemistry, the Ph.D. program provides the opportunity to become expert in research fields central to modern technology and science.

M.S. students must complete the professional development and leadership course, ENGI E4000 PROF DEVELOPMENT＆LEADERSHIP, as a graduation requirement. Doctoral students will be enrolled in ENGI E6001 Professional development and leadership for first year doctoral students–ENGI E6004 Professional development and leadership for fourth year doctoral students and should consult their program for specific PDL requirements.

Chemical Engineering (MS)
M.S. Degree

The requirements are:

    The core courses:
        Math core: Mathematical methods in chemical engineering (CHEN E4010 MATH METHODS IN CHEMICAL ENGIN),
        Transport core: Transport phenomena, III (CHEN E4110 MECHANISMS OF TRANSPORT) or Transport in fluid mixtures (CHEN E4112 TRANSPORT IN FLUID MIXTURES),
        Kinetics core: Advanced chemical kinetics (CHEN E4130 ADV CHEM ENGI THERMODYNAMICS) or Surface reactions and kinetics (CHEN E4235 SURFACE REACTIONS ＆ KINETICS), and
        Thermo core: Advanced chemical engineering thermodynamics (CHEN E4130 ADV CHEM ENGI THERMODYNAMICS)* or Statistical mechanics (CHAP E4120 STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND COMP METHODS); and
    18 points of 4000-level or higher courses, approved by the graduate coordinator or research adviser, of which up to 6 may be Master’s research (CHEN E9400 MASTERS RESEARCH). Students with undergraduate preparation in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacy, and related fields may enroll in the scientist-to-engineer (S2E) program that leads to the master’s degree in chemical engineering. This program requires an extra 6 credits associated with two mandatory Essentials classes (CHEN E4001 ESSENTIALS OF CHEM ENGIN A and CHEN E4002 ESSENTIALS OF CHEM ENGIN B) that are used to ease the transition into chemical engineering.

Specializations

Graduate elective specializations allow chemical engineering students to carry out in-depth exploration of a subject area in modern chemical engineering. To fulfill a specialization, the student must complete any combination of four courses (12 points total) from a list of technical elective courses that have been approved by the department to count towards that specialization. Courses taken P/F do not count towards specializations. Five specializations are offered: (i) Biotechnology; (ii) Climate Solutions; (iii) Data and Computational Science; (iv) Electrochemical Energy; and (v) Soft and Sustainable Materials.

Manufacturing and discovery in biotechnology and biopharmaceuticals continue to advance at a rapid pace, creating opportunities for engineers to contribute to interdisciplinary areas and apply their core skills to advancing technology. This MS program engages students with recent developments within biotechnology and biopharmaceuticals, focusing on engineering applications and approaches.

There is an established robust biopharmaceutical, fine chemical, and cosmetic industry located in the region (J&J, Merck, BMS, Regeneron, Celgene, Pfizer, L’Oreal, IFF) that can support student internships, research projects, as well as offer employment opportunities to graduates. In addition to these large companies, the metropolitan New York / New Jersey region also is home to many smaller start-up companies in this space and this is expected to grow in the future. The program features a selection of lecture-based courses, opportunities for research with faculty members, and potential industrial internships. In addition, students can gain laboratory experience within teaching laboratories, for example Biotechnology and Biopharmaceutical Lab and Tissue and Molecular Engineering Lab.

To satisfy the requirements for the Specialization in Biotechnology and Biopharmaceuticals, you must take 12 points (likely four courses) from the following list:

Once the bridge is completed with an overall 3.3 GPA or higher, students are then eligible for an automatic transfer into the M.S. in Computer Science program. Further information is available at cs.columbia.edu/ms-bridge.


EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
M.S. students must complete the professional development and leadership course, ENGI E4000 PROF DEVELOPMENT＆LEADERSHIP, as a graduation requirement. Doctoral students will be enrolled in ENGI E6001 Professional development and leadership for first year doctoral students–ENGI E6004 Professional development and leadership for fourth year doctoral students and should consult their program for specific PDL requirements.
Earth and Environmental Engineering (MS-EEE)

    Overview
    Curriculum

M.S. in Earth and Environmental Engineering (M.S.-EEE)

The M.S.-EEE program is designed for engineers and scientists who plan to pursue, or are already engaged in, environmental management/development careers. The focus of the program is the environmentally sound mining and processing of primary materials (minerals, energy, and water) to the recycling and proper disposal of used materials. The program also includes technologies for assessment and remediation of damages to the environment including water treatment, processing of mine tailings, and carbon capture, utilization and storage. Students can choose a pace that allows them to complete the M.S.-EEE requirements while being employed.

M.S.-EEE graduates are specially qualified to work for engineering, financial startup, and operating companies engaged in the earth resources development and environmental industries and technologies, environmental groups in all industries, and for city, state, and federal agencies responsible for the environment and energy/resource conservation. At the present time, the U.S. environmental industry comprises nearly 30,000 big and small businesses with total revenues of more than $150 billion. Sustainable development, climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as environmental quality have become top priorities of government and industries in the United States and many other nations.
This M.S. program is offered in collaboration with the Departments of Civil Engineering and Earth and Environmental Sciences. Many of the teaching faculty are affiliated with Columbia’s Earth Engineering Center. For students with a B.S. in engineering, at least 30 points (ten courses) are required. Students may carry out a research project (3 credits) or write a thesis worth 6 points. A number of areas of study are available for the M.S.-EEE, and students may choose courses that match their interest and career plans.

Additionally, there are three elective specializations in the program, in each of which there are a number of required specific core courses and electives. The specializations are described briefly below; details and the lists of specific courses for each track are available from the department. Students interested in a specific focus in Mining Engineering or related fields should consult their faculty adviser for relevant course listings.

Climate-induced risk is a significant component of decision making for the planning, design, and operation of water resource systems, and related sectors such as energy, health, agriculture, ecological resources, and natural hazards control. Climatic uncertainties can be broadly classified into two areas:

    those related to anthropogenic climate change;
    those related to seasonal- to century-scale natural variations.

Climate change impacts the design of physical, social, and financial infrastructure systems to support the sectors listed above. The climate variability and predictability issues impact systems operation, and hence design. The goal of the M.S. specialization in water resources and climate risks is to provide

    a capacity for understanding and quantifying the projections for climate change and variability in the context of decisions for water resources and related sectors of impact; and
    skills for integrated risk assessment and management for operations and design, as well as for regional policy analysis and management.

Required classes include:

    EACE E4252 Foundations of Environmental Engineering
    EACE E4163 Sustainable Water Treatment and Reuse 
    EAEE E4257 ENVIR DATA ANALYSIS ＆ MODELING

Building and shaping the energy infrastructure of the twenty-first century is one of the central tasks for modern engineering. The purpose of the sustainable energy specialization is to expose students to modern energy technologies and infrastructures and to the associated environmental, health, and resource limitations. Emphasis will be on energy generation and use technologies that aim to overcome the limits to growth that are experienced today. Energy and economic well-being are tightly coupled. Fossil fuel resources are still plentiful, but access to energy is limited by environmental and economic constraints. A future world population of 10 billion people trying to approach the standard of living of the developed nations cannot rely on today’s energy technologies and infrastructures without severe environmental impacts. Concerns over climate change and changes in ocean chemistry require reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, but most alternatives to conventional fossil fuels, including nuclear energy, are too expensive to fill the gap. Yet access to clean, cheap energy is critical for providing minimal resources: water, food, housing, and transportation.

Specialization-specific classes will sketch out the availability of resources, their geographic distribution, the economic and environmental cost of resource extraction, and avenues for increasing energy utilization efficiency, such as cogeneration, district heating, and distributed generation of energy. Classes will discuss technologies for efficiency improvement in the generation and consumption sector; energy recovery from solid wastes; alternatives to fossil fuels, including solar and wind energy, energy storage; and technologies for addressing the environmental concerns over the use of fossil fuels. Classes on climate change, air quality, and health impacts focus on the consequences of energy use. Policy and its interactions with environmental sciences and energy engineering will be another aspect of the specialization. Additional specialization may consider region-specific energy development. Required classes include:

    EAEE E4002 ALTERNATIVE ENERGY RESOURCES 
    EEEL E4220 Energy System Economics and Optimization

Earth mineral and metal resources are the backbone of civilization and are critical to economic development and meeting the demands of a growing population. their development today faces several big challenges:

    declining value content in the available ore bodies and poor quality of the resources;
    increasing focus on safety and health risks, and environmental impacts;
    inefficient and high energy and water consumption;
    huge risks associated with waste generation and management.

It is well recognized in the earth resource development industry that the traditional processing paradigm is no longer sustainable and cannot address these serious challenges. The overall goal of industry to develop and implement technologies for sensible and sustainable use of earth resources is part of a "mines of the future" paradigm, which encompasses topics such as mine-to-metal integration, modular processing, digital optimization, machine learning and AI, sensors and chemometrics, benign process chemicals, and a host of other forward-looking concepts. A similar effort and outlook exists for urban mining and recycling. The transformation of waste to energy and the recovery of minerals from recycling streams are examples of these areas that EEE is a world leader in. The EEE program in Sustainable Mining and Materials integrates foundational engineering principles and processes with the transformational innovations under development in the earth resources management sector. Core classes include:

    EAEE E4160 SOLID ＆ HAZARDOUS WASTE MGMT 
    EAEE E4200 Introduction to Sustainable Production of Earth Mineral ＆ Metal Resources
    EAEE E4228 Separation Science and Technology in Sustainable Earth Resources Development 

M.S. in Carbon Management (MCM)

The program is designed to prepare students to create and implement multi- faceted solutions to the carbon problem with an in-depth understanding of the complexity and multidisciplinary nature of the issues.
Coursework includes 30 credits of graduate coursework. Depending on student's backgrounds, some undergraduate level science courses may be required. Each student will develop an academic plan with the program director. There are three options for completing the 30 credits:

    30 credits of lecture courses
    24 credits of lecture courses and 6 credits of research with a culminating Master's Thesis
    27 credits of lecture courses and 3 credits of research with a concluding report

Earth and Environmental Engineering (EngScD, PhD)
Doctoral Programs

EEE offers two doctoral degrees:

    the Eng.Sc.D. degree, administered by Columbia Engineering; and
    the Ph.D. degree, administered by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

Doctoral Qualifying Examination and Research Proposal

Doctoral candidates are required to pass a qualifying examination. This examination is offered twice an academic year: once in the Fall and once in the Spring semesters.

Purpose

The qualifying exam evaluates whether doctoral students, after completing two semesters of courses, should continue with PhD research.

Prerequisite

To take the qualifying exam, students need

    To be enrolled in the MS/PhD Program in EEE
    At least 20 credits (two semesters) of coursework (credits from research do not count) and have taken at least two courses taught by EEE faculty members who are not their primary advisors.
    An overall GPA of 3.5 or higher

Format

Students should work with their advisor to select a committee composed of three EEE department members who represent focal areas of the department (energy, water, and material cycles). The PhD advisor may be a committee member.

One week before the exam, each committee member will provide a peer-reviewed research article (not a review paper) that the committee member believes is the intersection between the examinee's research topic and the examiner's area of expertise within EEE.

Students should give a 20-minute, uninterrupted presentation about their research and the three papers, followed by 40 minutes of questions and answers by the exam committee.

Evaluation criteria include the fundamental knowledge of DEEE's focal areas and the presentation's clarity. The evaluation can result in the following grades: Pass or Fail. There are no retakes of the exam.
Thesis Proposal

Students must submit a research proposal and present it to their advisory committee. The student advisory committee consists of at least three faculty members, including the advisor; at least two hold primary appointments in DEEE (with one tenured Full Professor).

A 10-page report (single-spaced) will be submitted to the committee seven days before the exam and used as part of the evaluation.

Students are generally expected to submit their thesis proposal after three semesters of doctoral studies.

The student advisory committee considers the scope of the proposed research, its suitability for doctoral research, and the appropriateness of the research plan.

The outcome of the evaluation of the thesis proposal: Pass, Fail, Conditional Pass (Conditional Pass: students will have to revise the proposal following comments by the members of the advisory committee and present the revised proposal within 6 months).


ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING


The Department of Electrical Engineering offers graduate programs leading to the degree of Master of Science (M.S.) and the degrees of Doctor of Engineering Science (Eng.Sc.D.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). The Graduate Record Examination (General Test only) is required of all applicants except special students. An undergraduate grade-point average equivalent to B or better from an institution comparable to Columbia is expected.

Applicants who, for good reasons, are unable to submit GRE test results by the deadline date but whose undergraduate record is clearly superior may file an application without the GRE scores. An explanatory note should be added to ensure that the application will be processed even while incomplete. If the candidate’s admissibility is clear, the decision may be made without the GRE scores; otherwise, it may be deferred until the scores are received.

There are no prescribed course requirements in any of the regular graduate degree programs. Students, in consultation with their faculty advisers, design their own programs, focusing on particular fields of electrical engineering. Among the fields of graduate study are Communications, Networking, Internet and Internet of Things; Computer Engineering; Integrated Circuits and Systems and Electronics; Integrated Devices and Photonics; Signals, Information, Data, Learning and Control; Smart Electric Energy; and Systems Biology and Neuroengineering.

Graduate course charts for several focus areas can be found at ee.columbia.edu.

M.S. students must complete the professional development and leadership course, ENGI E4000 PROF DEVELOPMENT＆LEADERSHIP, as a graduation requirement. Doctoral students will be enrolled in ENGI E6001 Professional development and leadership for first year doctoral students–ENGI E6004 Professional development and leadership for fourth year doctoral students and should consult their program for specific PDL requirements.

Electrical Engineering (MS)
Master of Science Degree

Candidates for the M.S. degree in electrical engineering must complete 30 points of credit beyond the bachelor’s degree. A minimum of 15 points of credit must be at the 6000 level or higher. No credit will be allowed for undergraduate courses (3000 or lower). At least 15 points must be in electrical engineering, defined as including all courses with an ELEN designator or a joint designator containing electrical engineering as a member, e.g., EECS, CSEE, EEME, ECBM, etc. And it is expected that at least 12 of the first 24 points taken will be in electrical engineering.

Not all technical courses can be applied toward the M.S. degree, and some have restrictions. Up to 6 points of research (such as ELEN E4998 INTERMEDIATE PROJECTS, ELEN E6001 ADVANCED PROJECTS, and ELEN E6002 ADVANCED PROJECTS) can be applied. Up to 1.5 points of fieldwork (ELEN E6999 FIELDWORK) can be used. No more than 3 points of courses that do not contain primarily engineering, math, or science content can be used, subject to the written pre-approval of the department. Any course that is not on the list of standard courses specified at ee.columbia.edu/ms-program-ee requires prior written department approval, including during the summer session.

The general school requirements listed earlier in this bulletin, such as minimum GPA, must also be satisfied. All degree requirements must be completed within five years of the beginning of the first course credited toward the degree.

More details and a requirements checklist for approvals can be found at ee.columbia.edu/ms-program-ee.
Optional M.S. Specializations

Students in the electrical engineering M.S. program often choose to use some of their electives to focus on a particular field. Students may pick one of a number of optional, formal specialization templates or design their own M.S. program in consultation with an adviser. These specializations are not degree requirements. They represent suggestions from the faculty as to how one might fill one’s programs so as to focus on a particular area of interest. Students may wish to follow these suggestions, but they need not. The degree requirements are quite flexible and are listed in the Master of Science Degree section, above. All students, whether following a formal specialization template or not, are expected to include breadth in their program. Not all of the elective courses listed here are offered every year. For the latest information on available courses, visit the Electrical Engineering home page at ee.columbia.edu.

The program educates students in both the fundamentals and the most advanced, cutting-edge developments in quantum science, including quantum computing and quantum information.

Students receive an M.S. from Columbia University. Taught by faculty from Columbia Engineering and the Department of Physics in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, this provides complementary hardware, experiments, and software skills that are critical for the quantum industry's future leaders. Coursework and research training will be taken both as a cohort and individually as students choose between physics- and engineering-based tracks with this dynamic curriculum.

A bachelor’s degree or its equivalent from an accredited institution is required for admission to the program.
Students must complete 30 points between Columbia Engineering and the Columbia Physics Department. These must include 15 points from the courses listed below that are deemed core to the program.

All QST MS students must complete the professional development and leadership course, ENGI E4000 PROF DEVELOPMENT＆LEADERSHIP, as a graduation requirement

The overall program must include a minimum of 15 additional credits, which includes electives in the Engineering Track and/or Physics Track. Up to 6 elective credits of research are allowed.

Electrical Engineering (PhD, EngScD)
Doctoral Degree

The requirements for the Ph.D. and Eng.Sc.D. degrees are identical. Both require a dissertation based on the candidate’s original research, conducted under the supervision of a faculty member. The work may be theoretical or experimental or both.

Students who wish to become candidates for the doctoral degree in electrical engineering have the option of applying for admission to the Eng.Sc.D. program or the Ph.D. program. Students who elect the Eng.Sc.D. degree register in the School of Engineering and Applied Science; those who elect the Ph.D. degree register in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

Doctoral candidates must obtain a minimum of 60 points of formal course credit beyond the bachelor’s degree. A master’s degree from an accredited institution may be accepted as equivalent to 30 points. A minimum of 30 points beyond the master’s degree must be earned while in residence in the doctoral program.

More detailed information regarding the requirements for the doctoral degree may be obtained in the department office and at ee.columbia.edu.


INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS RESEARCH


M.S. students must complete the professional development and leadership course, ENGI E4000 PROF DEVELOPMENT＆LEADERSHIP, as a graduation requirement. Doctoral students will be enrolled in ENGI E6001 Professional development and leadership for first year doctoral students–ENGI E6004 Professional development and leadership for fourth year doctoral students and should consult their program for specific PDL requirements.
Master of Science Programs

The Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research offers courses and M.S. programs in

    financial engineering on a full-time basis only;
    management science and engineering on a full-time basis only;
    business analytics on a full-time basis only;
    industrial engineering on either a full- or part-time basis; and
    operations research on either a full- or part-time basis.

Both the Department’s M.S. programs in Business Analytics and Management Science and Engineering are offered in conjunction with Columbia Business School. Lastly, the Department and Columbia Business School offer a combined M.S./M.B.A. degree program in industrial engineering.

All degree program applicants are required to take the Aptitude Tests of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). M.S./M.B.A. candidates are also required to take the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT). A minimum grade-point average of 3.0 (B) or its equivalent in an undergraduate engineering program is required for admission to the M.S. programs. At a minimum, students are expected, on entry, to have completed courses in ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, probability, and a programming language such as C, Java, or Python.

The Department requires that M.S. students achieve grades of B– or higher in each of the fundamental core courses in the discipline of study. Poor performance in core courses is indicative of inadequate preparation and is very likely to lead to serious problems in completing the program. As a result, students failing to meet this criterion may be asked to withdraw.

Courses taken at the School of Professional Studies will not be counted toward the M.S. degree in the IEOR Department (e.g., courses with the following prefixes: ACTU, BUSI, COPR, IKNS, SUMA, FUND, and more). Please consult with your academic adviser regarding electives offered in other departments and schools, prior to registration.

    STAT GU4001 INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS will not count toward the 18 IEOR point requirement.  

Operations Research has eight areas of concentrations, including:

    Analytics;

    Stochastic Modeling;

    Entrepreneurship and Innovation;

    Finance and Management;

    Healthcare Management;

    Logistics and Supply Chain Management;

    Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; and

    Optimization.

Students may select from a variety of approved electives from the Department, Columbia Business School, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Additional details regarding these concentrations and electives are available in the Departmental office and on IEOR's website at ieor.columbia.edu.  

Industrial Engineering (Joint MS and MBA)
Joint M.S. and M.B.A.

The Department and Columbia Business School offer a joint M.S. program in Industrial Engineering. Prospective students for this special program must submit separate applications to Columbia Engineering and Columbia Business School and be admitted to both schools for entrance into the joint program.

Admissions requirements are the same as those for the regular M.S. program in Industrial Engineering and for the M.B.A. This joint program is coordinated so that both degrees can be obtained after five terms of full-time study (30 points in two terms while registered in Columbia Engineering and 45 points in three terms while registered in Columbia Business School).

Students in the joint program must complete certain courses by the end of their first year of study. If a substantial equivalent has been completed during undergraduate studies, students should consult with a faculty adviser in order to obtain exemption from a required course.



Industrial Engineering (PhD), Operations Research (PhD)
Ph.D. Program

The IEOR Department offers two Ph.D. programs in

    Industrial Engineering; and
    Operations Research.

The requirements for the Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering and Ph.D. in Operations Research are identical. Both programs require the student to complete the qualifying procedure, fulfill the coursework requirements, and defend a dissertation based on the candidate's original research. The dissertation must be conducted under the supervision of an IEOR faculty advisor and may be theoretical or computational or both.
Qualifying Procedure

The qualifying procedure consists of two components:

    complete the four Ph.D. core courses during the first year with an average GPA of 3.66 or above; and 
    conduct research during the first summer (ideally starting in Spring or earlier), submit a 3-5 page extended abstract, and present the work in a department seminar at the beginning of the second academic year.

Students will be reviewed after each component. Students who fail to complete component (1) may be asked to withdraw from the program at the end of the first year. Students who successfully complete component (1) will typically move on to summer research advised by a faculty member in the IEOR department. 

In the rare instance that the PhD Committee is dissatisfied with a student's performance in component (2), the student may be asked to withdraw from the program during their second year. 
Coursework Requirements

Doctoral students are also required to take four additional Ph.D. level courses during the program. Students can consider courses from other departments including Mathematics, Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, and Decision, Risk and Operations. Ph.D. Research credits (IEOR E9101 RESEARCH) do not count toward this requirement.

Doctoral candidates must obtain a minimum of 60 points of formal course credit beyond the bachelor's degree. A master's degree from an accredited institution may be accepted as equivalent to 30 points. A minimum of 30 points beyond the master's degree must be earned while in residence in the doctoral program. Detailed information regarding the requirements for the doctoral degree may be obtained in the Department office and on the IEOR website at ieor.columbia.edu. 
Thesis Proposal and Dissertation Defense

Each student is expected to submit a research proposal and present it to a committee of three IEOR faculty members before the end of year 4. The committee considers the scope of the proposed research, its suitability for doctoral research and the appropriateness of the research plan. The committee may approve the proposal without reservation or may recommend modifications. 

In accordance with regulations of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, each student is expected to submit a final thesis and defend it before a committee of five faculty, one of whom holds a primary appointment in another department, school or university. 
MS/Ph.D. Track

Students admitted to the Ph.D. program without a master's degree in a related discipline are expected to fulfill additional requirements to earn a Master of Science after the first year, including:

    enroll full-time each semester
    complete a minimum of 30.0 credits in the first year, including the Ph.D. core courses
    receive passing letter grades for all classes

Students who successfully complete these requirements will receive the respective MS degree at the end of the first year. Those who also fulfill the qualifying requirements may continue on to the Ph.D. program. Those who do not meet the qualifying requirements will be dismissed from the program.  


MATERIALS SCIENCE

Materials Science and Engineering (MS)
Master of Science Degree

Candidates for the Master of Science degree in Materials Science and Engineering will follow a program of study formulated in consultation with and approved by a faculty adviser. Thirty points of credit (typically ten three-point courses) are required for the degree. The requirements include:

    Eighteen (18) points, MSAE 4000-, 6000-, 8000- level courses (max three points of research)1
    Six (6) points, approved electives (see following list) which may not include research points, e.g. MSAE E6273 MATERIALS SCIENCE REPORTS
    Six (6) points, general electives (which may include three additional points of research.)

Of the 30 points of credit required for the MS degree, 18 points of MSAE 4000-, 6000-, or 8000-level courses must be included. Only three points of research (MSAE E6273 MATERIALS SCIENCE REPORTS or other research course) may be used to satisfy the MSAE point requirement. A minimum of six points of MSAE courses must be taken in the first semester. Furthermore, it is expected that 15 of the first 24 points taken will be in MSAE courses; any exceptions must be approved by a faculty adviser.

Six points of restricted electives may be chosen from the following list of approved electives; a course not on the approved list can be counted only with prior, written approval. Research units may not be included.

Six points of electives may be chosen freely. These electives may include MSAE courses, approved electives, other electives, or an additional three points of research. As a reminder, no undergraduate courses (3000-level or below) may be counted toward the degree.

Students who do not have an undergraduate degree in Materials Science and Engineering may be required to take MSAE E4301 MATERIALS SCIENCE LABORATORY in the first semester. Students will be informed whether they are required to take this course based on a review of their undergraduate transcripts, no later than the first week of classes. The three credits for this course will be counted against the six points of general electives, and not against the six points of restricted electives or eighteen points of MSAE courses.

Students interested in a specific focus in metallurgy or other areas in materials science and engineering should consult their faculty adviser for relevant course listings.

Materials Science and Engineering (EngScD, PhD)
Doctoral Program

At the end of the first year of graduate study in the doctoral program, candidates are required to take a comprehensive written qualifying examination, which is designed to test the ability of the candidate to apply coursework in problem solving and creative thinking. The standard is first-year graduate level. There are two three-hour examinations over a two-day period.

Candidates in the program must take the oral examination by the end of the spring semester of their second year. Candidates must submit a written proposal and defend it orally before a Thesis Proposal Defense Committee consisting of three members of the faculty, including the adviser, in the spring semester of their third year. Doctoral candidates must submit a thesis to be defended before a Dissertation Defense Committee consisting of five faculty members, including two professors from outside the doctoral program. Requirements for the Eng. Sc.D. (administered by the School of Engineering and Applied Science) and the Ph.D. (administered by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences) can be found on the Doctoral Degrees page.
Areas of Research

Materials science and engineering is concerned with synthesis, processing, structure, and properties of metals, ceramics, and other materials, with emphasis on understanding and exploiting relationships among structure, properties, and applications requirements. Our graduate research programs encompass research areas as diverse as polycrystalline silicon, electronic ceramics grain boundaries and interfaces, microstructure and stresses in microelectronics thin films, oxide thin films for novel sensors and fuel cells, optical diagnostics of thin-film processing, ceramic nanocomposites, electrodeposition and corrosion processes, structure, properties, and transmission electron microscopy and crystal orientation mapping, magnetic thin films for spintronic applications, chemical synthesis of nanoscale materials, nanocrystals, two-dimensional materials, nanostructure analysis using X-ray and neutron diffraction techniques, and electronic structure calculation of materials using density functional and dynamical mean-field theories. Application targets for polycrystalline silicon are thin film transistors for active matrix displays and silicon-on-insulator structures for ULSI devices. Novel applications are being developed for oxide thin films, including uncooled IR focal plane arrays and integrated fuel cells for portable equipment.

Thin film synthesis and processing in this program include evaporation, sputtering, electrodeposition, and plasma and laser processing. For analyzing materials structures and properties, faculty and students employ electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, photoluminescence, magnetotransport measurements, and X-ray diffraction techniques. Faculty members have research collaborations with IBM, and other New York area research and manufacturing centers, as well as major international research centers. Scientists and engineers from these institutions also serve as adjunct faculty members at Columbia. The National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory is used for high-resolution X-ray diffraction and absorption measurements.

Entering students typically have undergraduate degrees in materials science, metallurgy, physics, chemistry, or other science and engineering disciplines. First-year graduate courses provide a common base of knowledge and technical skills for more advanced courses and for research. In addition to coursework, students usually begin an association with a research group, individual laboratory work, and participation in graduate seminars during their first year.


MECHANICAL ENGINEERING

The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers two doctoral degrees: Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and Doctor of Engineering Science (Eng.Sc.D.), and the Master of Science degree. The Ph.D. degree is conferred by the Graduate School of Arts and Science, and the Eng.Sc.D. degree is conferred by The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.

M.S. students must complete the professional development and leadership course, ENGI E4000 PROF DEVELOPMENT＆LEADERSHIP, as a graduation requirement. Doctoral students will be enrolled in ENGI E6001 Professional development and leadership for first year doctoral students–ENGI E6004 Professional development and leadership for fourth year doctoral students and should consult their program for specific PDL requirements.

Mechanical Engineering (MS)
Typical choices in the standard track include such subjects as mechanics of solids and fluids, thermodynamics, heat transfer, manufacturing engineering, robotics, kinematics, dynamics and vibrations, controls, and power generation. Nevertheless, the following guidelines must be adhered to:

    All courses must be at the graduate level, i.e., numbered 4000 or higher, with at least two 6000-level lecture courses in SEAS. At least one of the 6000-level courses must be in Mechanical Engineering.
    Every program must contain at least one course in mathematics (APMA, MATH, STAT course designations) covering material beyond what the student has taken previously. It is recommended to be taken early in the sequence, in order to serve as a basis for the technical coursework. Alternatively, any one of the following courses may be taken to satisfy the math requirement:

All applications to the doctoral program in mechanical engineering are administered by The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. Students who matriculate into the doctoral program without a master's degree earn a Master of Science degree while pursuing their doctoral degree.

Doctoral candidates are expected to attain a level of mastery in an area of mechanical engineering and must therefore choose a field and take the most advanced courses offered in that field. Candidates are assigned a faculty adviser whose task is to help choose a program of courses, provide general advice on academic matters, and monitor academic performance. Candidates also choose a faculty member in the pertinent area of specialization to serve as their research adviser. This adviser helps select a research problem and supervises the research, writing, and defense of the dissertation.
