In addition, students will be charged a housing fee once they
leave a university residence. All application fees, late fees, and
other special fees are not refundable if the student withdraws

dismissed from the University and are on the Columbia Student

83Academic Requirements
may take the class again and earn credit for the second
instance of the course. In the very rare circumstance in which
a student has earned credit for a course and feels it necessary
to retake the course to show a stronger performance, the
grades for both instances of the course will appear on the
transcript, but only the first instance of the course will earn
credit and only the final grade earned in the first instance of
the course will count towards the overall GPA as measured
by the degree audit report that students can access through
Vergil/SSOL.
ACADEMIC
REQUIREMENTS
In order to graduate from Columbia College with a Bachelor
of Arts (B.A.) degree, a student must successfully complete
a minimum of 124 points of academic coursework, which
must include the full Core Curriculum and all requirements
for a major. Additionally, a student must have earned a
cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or higher to be eligible
to graduate.
• Duplicative coursework: Students may not earn credit
multiple times for course content that is essentially
duplicative, as in the following cases:
Students are expected to complete the B.A. degree in eight full-
time semesters. The last two semesters must be taken while
enrolled in the College for study on Columbia's Morningside
campus or on one of the Columbia-sponsored international
programs.
• Students cannot take two courses that have essentially the
same function within the structure of the undergraduate
curriculum. For example, credit cannot be earned for two
first-term calculus courses, even if one is more theoretical
in approach than the other. Similarly, credit cannot be
earned for two comparable terms of a science or foreign
language even if one has a Barnard course number and
the other a Columbia course number.
Academic Credit
A point of academic credit is awarded to a student for
coursework based on the successful completion of a certain
number of contact hours with an instructor in class and a certain
number of hours of coursework done outside of class. Generally
speaking, one point of academic credit denotes 14 hours of in-
class work and approximately 28 hours of out-of-class work.
Most undergraduate courses carry between 3 and 5 points of
academic credit.
Every Columbia College student must complete 124 points
of academic credit to earn the B.A. degree from Columbia
College. To complete this number of credits over 8 semesters,
students will need to complete an average of 15.5 credits per
semester, which typically represents 4 to 5 academic courses per
term (of courses that are worth between 3 and 5 points of credit
each). According to the expectations of workload per credit hour
noted above, a 15.5-credit academic course load will require a
minimum of 46.5 hours of work per week, spent attending class
and doing homework.
All courses listed in this Bulletin are open to Columbia College
students and carry credit that can be earned toward the B.A.
degree. If students are interested in courses that are not listed in
this Bulletin, it is important that they consult their advising dean
in the Berick Center for Student Advising to confirm that the
course will carry credit toward the B.A. degree.
It is expected that every course that a student takes is adding to
the student’s education, increasing the student’s knowledge, and
improving the student’s skills. Therefore, students may not earn
credit for a course more than once, except in the case of a course
that has been approved to be taken more than once (e.g., certain
music performance courses, certain research courses).
• Retaking a course: If a student receives a failing grade in a
course and therefore does not receive credit for it, the student
• If students have been granted academic credit through
advanced standing credit (AP, IB, GCE, etc.), they may
not take the equivalent course(s) at Columbia for credit.
If students do take the equivalent course(s) at Columbia,
they will need to forfeit the advanced standing credit
previously granted. For more information, see Academic
Regulations—Placement and Advanced Standing.
• If students have been granted academic credit through
transfer credit for coursework at another college or
university, they may not take the equivalent course(s) at
Columbia for credit. If students do take the equivalent
course(s) at Columbia, they will need to forfeit the
transfer credit previously granted.
The Core Curriculum
The Core Curriculum (p. 90) represents the College's
approach to general education requirements:
• Six shared courses, in which all students study the same
content and learn foundational academic habits of mind and
habits of work;
• Discipline-specific courses chosen by students from lists of
approved courses, in which students learn specific content
that conveys ways of knowing and understanding; and
• The Physical Education requirement.

Physical Education
Two courses and a swimming test
All of the courses in the full Core Curriculum must be taken
for a letter grade (i.e., the Pass/D/Fail option may not be
applied) – with the exception of courses for the Physical
Education requirement, which are offered only on a "pass/
withdrawal" basis.
Students are required to complete Frontiers of Science, both
semesters of Literature Humanities, and University Writing
in the first year. Students who do not successfully complete
all of these requirements by the end of the first year will be
placed on academic probation.
All students are required to take Contemporary Civilization
in their sophomore year. For pedagogical reasons, the College
considers Literature Humanities a prerequisite for Contemporary
Civilization; therefore, all Columbia College students must
complete Literature Humanities prior to taking Contemporary
Civilization. (Columbia Engineering students, who may also
enroll in Contemporary Civilization, have been given an
exception to this sequence because of the structure of their
curriculum.)
Students are encouraged to complete Art Humanities and
Music Humanities by the end of the junior year.
Courses taken to fulfill the Core Curriculum must be taken in
Columbia College – with the exception of the Foreign Language
Requirement, which, in some instances and as determined by the
relevant academic department at Columbia, may be satisfied at
Barnard College.
If students plan to take courses at an approved study abroad
program that seem to fulfill the stated goals of the Global Core
or Science requirements, students may petition the Committee
on the Global Core or the Committee on Science Instruction
– through their advising dean in the Berick Center for Student
Advising –to ask if the course might be approved for the relevant
requirement. Also, if a student has fallen behind on the required
number of credits and requirements to be in good academic
standing, the student may be able to petition the Committee
on Academic Standing to take approved courses at another
institution during the summer in order to regain good academic
standing.
The Major
All Columbia College students must complete a major. By
requiring both breadth and depth of study in one particular
discipline or field, the major ensures intensive study in a
single academic program, typically through a combination of
introductory courses, methods courses, advanced seminars,
and possibly a senior capstone experience such as a thesis.
Majors are designed and offered by a variety of Columbia
departments, institutes, centers, and programs, and are described
in the departmental sections of this Bulletin (see Departments,
Programs, and Courses).
Students select individual majors based on their own
particular aims and needs. A major is not designed to produce
professionally trained specialists for one profession or another;
in fact, students often pursue careers that are not dependent on
the specific content of their majors. Rather, the major provides a
particular way of understanding and of working that students can
translate into any number of professional contexts.
In the first and sophomore years, students can consult a network
of advisers as they consider their choice of a major; this
network includes faculty members in academic departments
and programs, advising deans in the Berick Center for Student
Advising, and advisers in the Center for Career Education.
Students declare a major through an online declaration
process in their fourth semester (i.e., spring semester
of sophomore year). Students are not permitted to declare
a major before this time. Some majors will also require
departmental review at the time of declaration, and students
should consult with the DUS of their department to confirm that
they can complete their major by the end of their 8th semester.
Information about the process for declaring a major is sent
to students in the spring of the sophomore year by the Berick
Center for Student Advising.
Every student is responsible for completing the requirements
for a major within eight full-time semesters. Students should
complete the requirements for a major that are in effect as of
the time that they declare the major in their sophomore year.
Students are expected to be active in consulting advisers in the
major, especially the relevant director of undergraduate studies
for each major.
85Academic Requirements
The requirements for a major are determined by the faculty
of the relevant academic department or program, and each
department or program has one or more faculty members
designated as a director of undergraduate studies. A director
of undergraduate studies (DUS) for a department or
program provides advising on the individual courses and the
programs of study for undergraduates in that department
or program, and DUS can offer guidance to students who
are prospective majors, who are declared majors, or who are
simply taking a course in the department or program.
Students can find information about all majors available to them
in the pages of this Bulletin and on the websites of individual
departments, institutes, and centers. Students should familiarize
themselves with the requirements of any academic programs by
reading through the requirements for their proposed major and
by directing questions to the relevant director of undergraduate
studies.
the mix of courses to fulfill a major and courses to fulfill the
Core Curriculum. To the extent that students have additional
space in their programs of study for elective coursework, they
might choose to take a mix of liberal arts courses in a variety
of departments, or they might give their elective coursework
shape by declaring another program of study. While students can
declare a second major, more often students who wish to pursue
another program of study will opt to a secondary course of study
in the form of an academic minor.
Smaller than a major program of study, an academic minor
typically requires between 5 and 9 courses to complete, and it
offers students the opportunity to increase their exposure to the
breadth of the liberal arts curriculum in ways that are curated by
the faculty’s expertise and interests. The goals and structures of
a minor can vary, and may have one of the following purposes:
• an introduction to a discipline, stopping short of the
advanced work of a major;
All courses taken to complete a major, whether they are
designated as required or elective within the major, must be
taken for a letter grade and must be passed with a grade of
C- or higher. Some academic departments permit an exception
to this policy, allowing the first one-term course taken by the
student in his or her eventual major to be taken for a mark of
"Pass." Students should consult the director of undergraduate
studies (DUS) for any permissions or restrictions on grading
options for the major.
• a cluster of courses that introduce students to a topic through
multiple approaches;
• an advanced offering for students who have previous
preparation in order to pursue a particular focus of study that
builds on departmental strengths and specializations;
• a complement to an existing major, such as a subfield in a
cognate department; or
The size and structure of a major can vary from one department/
program to the next, and students may need to understand these
details and distinctions as early as possible. For example:
• Some majors require that certain introductory courses be
completed before the start of the junior year.
• Some majors have different minimum and maximum points
allowed for a concentration or a major.
• Majors may have different policies on whether students can
fulfill one requirement with a grade of D or a mark of "Pass."
A student can change majors at any time as long as the requisite
departmental approval is received, the requirements have been
or can be fulfilled, and students can still graduate by the end of
their eighth semester. If a student decides to change a major,
the student must file a new declaration form online or in hard
copy with the advising dean in the Berick Center for Student
Advising.
Independent majors (i.e., programs of study designed by a
student) are not permitted for Columbia College students.
Minors
Most students graduate from Columbia College with one
program of study – i.e., with one major. Majors vary in the
number and type of required courses, and students may find
that they have very full programs of study each semester with
• an interdisciplinary program including courses in one or
more departments/programs.
Students can find information about all minors available to them
in the pages of this Bulletin and on the websites of individual
departments, institutes, and centers. Students should familiarize
themselves with the requirements of any academic programs by
reading through the requirements for minors and by directing
questions to the relevant director of undergraduate studies.
Students can declare a minor at the same time that they declare
a major, in the Spring semester of their sophomore year, or they
can declare a minor at a later point if they determine that they
have the interest and space in their program of study to complete
one. Information about the process for declaring a major is sent
to students in the spring of the sophomore year by the Berick
Center for Student Advising.
Special Programs
In certain cases, the College has partnered with Columbia’s
professional schools or affiliated programs to offer a special
program of study that goes beyond the liberal arts curriculum
offered to College students. If a student completes one of these
programs, it will appear on the student’s transcript as a “special
program.” Therefore, a special program can only be pursued as
a second program of study; a student pursuing a special program
must also complete a major in order to earn the B.A. degree.
86Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Maximum Number of Programs
of StudyPolicy on Double-Counting
Courses toward Requirements
Most students graduate from Columbia College with one
program of study – i.e., with one major. Majors vary in the
number and type of required courses, and students may find that
they have very full programs of study each semester with the
mix of courses to fulfill a major and courses to fulfill the Core
Curriculum.If a student chooses to declare more than one program of study
(some combination of major, minor, or special program, subject
to the conditions noted above), the student can, in certain
situations, apply one course to two programs of study (“double-
counting”). There are three conditions under which students may
apply one course to two programs of study, and depending on
the declared programs of study, some or all of these conditions
may apply:
To the extent that students have additional space in their
programs of study for elective coursework, they might choose
to take a mix of liberal arts courses in a variety of departments,
or they might give their elective coursework shape by declaring
another program of study. While students can declare a second
major, more often students who wish to pursue another program
of study will opt to a secondary course of study in the form of an
academic minor or a special program (described above).
1. If two programs of study require the same fundamental
skills as prerequisite for all further study in those programs,
students may double-count those fundamental courses to both
programs of study. The Committee on Instruction has defined
this fundamental coursework as any of the following courses:
a. elementary and intermediate foreign language courses;
Students must complete their degree requirements within eight
semesters (including the terms that transfer students have spent
at other institutions), and students will not be awarded additional
semesters for the purposes of completing an additional program
of study.
b. the calculus sequence (I through IV, Accelerated
Multivariable Calculus, or Honors A and B);
c. introductory courses in Statistics (STAT UN1101 or
UN1201); and
The maximum number of programs that a student can declare is
three, subject to the following conditions:d. the introductory course in computer programming
(COMS W1004).
1. Students may declare a maximum of three programs of study
(a program of study defined as a major, a minor, or a special
program).e. If faculty members feel that other courses should be
included in this category, those courses would need to be
explicitly approved by the Committee on Instruction for
double-counting.
2. A student may not declare more than two majors.
3. A student may not declare more than two minors.
4. If a student wishes to declare more than one program of
study, the coursework for the additional program(s) of study
should fit comfortably within the expected course load of
4-5 courses per semester. Students will not be permitted to
petition regularly to exceed the 18-credit point limit in order
to pursue additional programs of study.
If a student decides to pursue multiple programs of study, they
may not both be governed by the same offering unit (department,
institute, or center). For example, a student may not declare
two majors, or a major and a minor, in Russian Language and
Culture and in Slavic Studies, both of which are housed in the
Department of Slavic Languages. Similarly, a student may not
declare programs in Mathematics and in Applied Mathematics,
both of which are governed by the Department of Mathematics.
All joint majors are considered as governed by both offering
units: for example, the Economics-Political Science major is
governed by both the Economics department and the Political
Science department, so that a student may not declare programs
in both Political Science and Economics-Political Science.
2. In addition to double-counting any of the courses described
in #1 above, students may double-count courses toward
programs of study (major or minor) that are taken to fulfill
three parts of the Core Curriculum: (1) the Global Core
requirement and/or (2) the Science requirement and/or (3) the
Language requirement. Note: The shared courses of the Core
Curriculum – specifically, Art Humanities, Contemporary
Civilization, Frontiers of Science, Literature Humanities,
Music Humanities, and University Writing – may not be
double-counted with any major or minor.
3. In addition to double-counting any courses described in #1
and #2 above, students pursuing two programs of study may
double-count a maximum of two classes of any type, if the
classes are already approved to fulfill a requirement for each
program of study. Students should not petition Directors of
Undergraduate Studies for substitutions to major or minor
requirements in order to create opportunities for double-
counting. Offering departments, institutes, or centers may
choose to restrict the double-counting of particular courses,
and such restrictions cannot be appealed.
87Academic Requirements
If any of the conditions above happens to apply to three declared
programs, the “double-counting” will apply across the three
programs of study.
Supervised Independent Study
It is sometimes possible for students to pursue independent
advanced work on a topic for credit under the supervision of
a faculty member. Students must develop a plan of study with
a faculty adviser that details the workload of the independent
study (i.e., the weekly reading and/or research, and the
assignments that will be submitted and assessed), as well as the
plan for regular meetings with the faculty member in fulfillment
of the required contact hours between instructor and student.
Students must also obtain the approval of the department;
approval depends on the quality of the proposal, the student’s
qualifications, and the availability of an appropriate faculty
adviser. Independent study may earn variable credit (between 1
and 6 credits), depending on the planned workload and meeting
schedule; the department can determine the appropriate number
of credits.
Academic Advising
Planning an Academic Program
A student’s “academic program” is the full complement of
courses in which the student is registered in an academic term–
the combination of subjects, topics, and credits that a student
plans to complete in a given semester.
When planning an academic program for each semester, students
should ensure the following:
1. Students are thoroughly familiar with the requirements for
the degree – including the full Core Curriculum and the
requirements for a major – and with the College regulations,
all of which are detailed in this Bulletin (see details above in
section on “Majors”);
2. Students plan to complete University Writing (ENGL
CC1010), Frontiers of Science (SCNC CC1000),
Masterpieces of Western Literature and Philosophy I & II
(HUMA CC1001-HUMA CC1002) during the first year,
as well as Introduction to Contemporary Civilization in
the West (COCI CC1101 -COCI CC1102) by the end of
the sophomore year (see details above in section on “Core
Curriculum”);
3. Students prepare to declare a major in their fourth term (i.e.,
spring semester of sophomore year).
In particular, students should note that some majors require
that certain introductory courses be completed before the start
of the junior year. For example, students considering a major
in the sciences should focus on required introductory science
courses in their first two years, in addition to Core requirements;
students considering a concentration or major in the humanities
and social sciences should try to take, in their first two years, a
combination of Core requirements and introductory level courses
in the department(s) in which they are interested in majoring.
Similarly, study abroad, professional programs, and graduate
schools have a range of requirements that must be successfully
completed at prescribed times during the undergraduate career.
When planning their academic program, students are expected
to consult with their advising deans in the Berick Center for
Student Advising and with the faculty advisers in the relevant
academic departments.
Advising Deans
Advising deans in the Berick Center for Student Advising
advise students on general graduation requirements and monitor
students’ progress toward completing the Core Curriculum.
Advising deans guide and support undergraduates at Columbia
College as they navigate their academic and co-curricular lives
at Columbia University. Students are assigned an advising dean
in the summer before matriculation.
Productive advising is built on a partnership in which the student
and the adviser work together: the spirit of an ideal advising
partnership is one of mutual engagement, responsiveness, and
dedication. Regular advising conversations - the fundamental
building blocks of the partnership - enable an adviser to serve
as a knowledgeable resource, reliable guide, and a source
for referrals, so that students may make the most of all the
opportunities available to them inside and outside the classroom
during their time at the College.
Students can make appointments with their advising deans using
the online appointment system. While students have assigned
advising deans, students may make appointments with any of the
advisers in the Berick Center for Student Advising, and students
may also attend walk-in hours in person or virtually to speak
to an “adviser of the day” during business hours. Students who
wish to change assigned advising deans are encouraged to make
an appointment with Andrew Plaa, Dean of Advising, who can
make new adviser assignments.
Directors of Undergraduate Studies
Directors of Undergraduate Studies (DUS), and other faculty in
academic departments, advise students on the requirements for
majors, minors, and special programs.
Students should feel free to consult a DUS as early as possible
to discuss the goals, content, and shape of a program of study
(major, minor, or special program). The DUS can advise
prospective majors or minors on the specific requirements for
a program of study, can spell out options for paths through the
program of study, and can suggest the most appropriate courses
for a student’s academic program. When a student has decided to
declare a particular program of study, the DUS can confirm that
the student is on track to complete the program of study on time
and can also advise the student on finding related opportunities
in the field in areas such as research, internships, jobs, etc.
Under no circumstances will students be granted more than 8
semesters to complete a secondary course of study (i.e., a minor
88Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
or a special program or second major), so it is important for
students to actively consult their advising deans and the relevant
directors of undergraduate studies to confirm their academic
progress as they plan each semester.
Advising for First-Year
Students
In the summer before matriculating to Columbia College,
each incoming student receives the Academic Planning Guide
for New Students, which is designed to assist incoming
students in planning and creating their academic programs.
Incoming students will also receive information by email
about opportunities to talk with their advising dean during
that summer, and students should read the Academic Planning
Guide for New Students carefully prior to their first advising
appointment.
Each incoming first-year student will be preregistered for a
section of Literature Humanities for the Fall term. Each student
will also be preregistered for either a section of Frontiers of
Science or a section of University Writing. Therefore, students
will have two courses assigned to their Fall academic programs
when they arrive on campus, and they will register themselves
for the remaining courses during the New Student Orientation
Program and/or during the Change of Program period (i.e., the
first two weeks of classes).
For the Spring term of the first year, students will be pre-
registered in the section of Literature Humanities that
corresponds with their Fall section (i.e., usually with the same
instructor at the same time of the week), but it will be possible
to change sections if schedule conflicts arise. First-year students
who have taken University Writing in the Fall will be pre-
registered in a section of Frontiers of Science in the Spring.
First-year students who have taken Frontiers of Science in the
Fall will register themselves for a section of University Writing
in the Spring.
as sophomores or juniors, with the following considerations for
their status as transfer students:
In order to graduate from Columbia College with a Bachelor
of Arts (B.A.) degree, all transfer students must successfully
complete a minimum of 124 points of academic credit, which
must include the full Core Curriculum – with the exception
of CC1000 Frontiers of Science, though three courses from
the approved Science Requirement list must be completed. In
addition, transfer students must satisfy all requirements for a
major –or, for transfer students who matriculated prior to Fall
2024, all requirements for a concentration – and the overall GPA
for all coursework completed must be 2.0 or higher.
Transfer students are expected to complete the B.A. degree
in six full-time semesters (for students entering Columbia
College in the sophomore year) or four full-time semesters (for
students entering Columbia College in the junior year). The
last two semesters must be taken while enrolled in the College
for study on this campus or on one of the Columbia-sponsored
international programs.
Class standing for students transferring to Columbia College is
determined prior to matriculation and is based on the number
of terms and credits completed at the home institution. Twelve
credits is the equivalent of one full-time term. A transfer
student's class standing will remain in place for the duration
of the student's time in Columbia College, regardless of future
credits earned. Once they have matriculated, transfer students
may be assigned additional advanced standing like Advanced
Placement, International Baccalaureate and other standardized
examination credit, but their class status will remain the same.
This policy remains in place even when students are eligible to
graduate in less than eight terms.
Upon admission to Columbia College, transfer students should
familiarize themselves with the regulations pertaining to their
special status (see Academic Regulations—Regulations for
Transfer Students).
All incoming first-year students are expected to meet with
their advising deans in the Berick Center for Student Advising
during the summer (in person, by phone, or online), during the
New Student Orientation Program (NSOP), and/or in the first
two weeks of the term (Change-of-Program period) in order to
discuss their fall course selections, their transition to college,
and their short- and long-term goals, and to learn about other
advising resources and offices available to them at Columbia.
Students are expected to stay in touch regularly with their
advising deans in the Berick Center for Student Advising
throughout their time at Columbia.

89Core Curriculum
CORE
CURRICULUM
The Center for the Core Curriculum
core-curriculum@columbia.edu
The Core Curriculum is the heart of the Columbia College
education. The central intellectual mission of the Core is to
provide all students with wide-ranging perspectives, a deeper
understanding of history, and critical and creative thinking skills
through the study of literature, science, philosophy, music, and
art.
The Core was the first college general education program in
the United States, launched as a single course, Contemporary
Civilization, in 1919 with the goal of preparing students to
grapple with “the insistent problems of the present.” In a context
of global crisis, social reform, and widespread debates about
the aims and methods of higher learning, Columbia College
offered Contemporary Civilization as a bold experiment in what
philosopher John Dewey called “progressive education.” That
is, rather than focusing on the transmission of knowledge and
the development of expertise, Contemporary Civilization would
provide students with a space to develop their own ideas and
create knowledge collectively at the intersection of historical
consciousness and self-awareness.
In the century that followed, the Core evolved considerably,
adding Literature Humanities in 1937 and Art Humanities
and Music Humanities a decade later. That same year, 1947,
a new course in Asian Humanities was introduced, adding
a further global dimension to the curriculum. What is now
called the Global Core — formerly Major Cultures — became
a requirement in 1990. After decades of failed attempts to
include scientific inquiry in the curriculum, Frontiers of Science
was launched as a Core requirement in 2004. Together, these
Core courses explore the stories, ideas, images, sounds, and
discoveries through which we make ourselves intelligible to one
another.
Each course in the Core undergoes regular review and revision
to respond to the ever-changing challenges of our modern
world and to incorporate a growing number of perspectives
and experiences. Through all of these changes, the Core has
provided an enriching liberal arts experience of community,
active learning, and interdisciplinary inquiry in the larger context
of a research university. The Core creates a shared intellectual
experience for students that is rooted in mutual respect, fostering
close and lasting intellectual relationships with peers and faculty
through discussion. This community extends across course
sections, class years, and even generations.
chosen fields of study. The general academic skills that students
develop in Core classes are useful in a range of contexts,
counterbalancing the specialization of chosen majors. Most
importantly, Core courses give students the opportunity to
experiment with ideas, pursue their own inquiries, develop
their own perspectives, and critique the shared opinions and
social practices of our world through an understanding of their
histories. In this way, the Core prepares students for a lifetime of
critical and creative intelligence.
The Center for the Core Curriculum, located in 202 Hamilton,
provides administrative support to faculty and students in Art
Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Frontiers of Science,
Literature Humanities, and Music Humanities. The Center can
be contacted at core-curriculum@columbia.edu.
The Committee on the Core Curriculum manages the academic
elements of the Core, with faculty representatives from Art
Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Frontiers of Science,
Literature Humanities, Music Humanities, University Writing,
and the Global Core, as well as administrators and student
representatives from Columbia College and General Studies.

Literature Humanities Website
HUMA CC1001 and HUMA CC1002 “Literature Humanities’’
or “Lit Hum,” as it is popularly known, is a year-long course
that offers Columbia College students the opportunity to engage
in intensive study and discussion of significant works. A part
of the Core Curriculum since 1937, Literature Humanities is
not a survey with a fixed syllabus, but an ever-evolving series
of carefully selected readings that reward both first encounters
and long study. Whether classwork focuses attention on the
formal elements of the text, its importance to literary history,
or on its significance to contemporary culture and issues, the
goal is to consider a range of perspectives across time and
cultures that can enhance our understanding of the world and
foster a deeper sense of empathy, while also developing crucial
skills in close reading, critical thinking, writing, and academic
discussion through the analysis of literary works.
Instructors from a range of departments and disciplines meet
with groups of approximately twenty-two students for four
hours a week in order to discuss texts by Enheduanna, Homer,
Sappho, Aeschylus, Plato, Vergil, Augustine, Ibn ‘Arabi, Marie
de France, Dante, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Sor Juana Inés de la
Cruz, Austen, Woolf, Morrison, and Rankine, as well as Hebrew
Scriptures, Gospels, and Gilgamesh.
Registration Procedure
All information concerning registration in
HUMA CC1001-HUMA CC1002 is included in the registration
materials sent to students. All first-year students are
preregistered in Literature Humanities. Students can change
their section during their registration period prior to the start of
the semester and the change of program period during the first
two weeks of the semester.
All Core Curriculum courses, including Literature
Humanities, must be taken for a letter grade. Students may not
drop or withdraw from Literature Humanities after the Core
drop deadline, which is also the end of the Change-of-Program
period (p. 4). For more information, see Registration—Dropping
Core Courses.
Courses of Instruction
HUMA CC1001 Literature Humanities I. 4.00 points.
Taught by members of the Departments of Classics; English
and Comparative Literature; French; German; Italian; Middle
Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies; Philosophy;
Religion; Slavic Languages; and Latin American and Iberian
Cultures; as well as members of the Society of Fellows. Major
works by over twenty authors, ranging in time, theme, and
genre, from Homer to Virginia Woolf. Students are expected to
write at least two papers, to complete two examinations each
semester, and to participate actively in class discussions

Civilization
Chair for Contemporary Civilization
Prof. Carol Rovane
Violin Family Professor of Philosophy
cr260@columbia.edu
Contemporary Civilization Website
22/21
The purpose of COCI CC1101-COCI CC1102 “Contemporary
Civilization,” or “CC,” as it is popularly known, is to
introduce students to a range of issues concerning the kinds
95Contemporary Civilization
of communities—political, social, moral, and religious—that
human beings construct, and the values that inform and define
such communities. Founded in 1919 to prepare students to
confront "the insistent problems of the present," Contemporary
Civilization has evolved continuously while remaining a
constant element of the Columbia College curriculum. The
course asks students to read texts that offer a wide range
of perspectives, to experiment with ideas, follow their own
inquiries, and present their own perspectives about the issues
that these texts raise. In doing so, students develop their skills as
thinkers and communicators.
The aim of Contemporary Civilization is not to endorse or
celebrate the often conflicting— and sometimes troubling
— ideas of the authors studied in class, but rather to engage
with them critically. By exploring a range of perspectives,
students will gain a better sense of the ideas that have shaped
the world they have inherited, develop the power to imagine
experiences and understand opinions different from their own,
and test their own values in a way that may strengthen them or
prompt revision. The ultimate goal of Contemporary Civilization
is to foster a community in which students can share their
perplexity, deepen their understanding of the world and their
place within it, recognize the limits of their own perspectives
and experiences, and engage respectfully with one another
across their differences.

Because Contemporary Civilization is a year-long course,
readings are necessarily selective. Every three years, faculty
revise the syllabus, and many instructors supplement readings
with their own selections. The factors that lead to the adoption
of a text include historical influence, the demonstrated ability
of a text to provoke productive discussion, and the relevance
of a text's ideas to the pressing problems of the present.
Among the authors currently required in the course are Plato,
Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Christine de Pizan, Machiavelli,
Descartes, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Smith, Kant, Bentham,
Wollstonecraft, Tocqueville, J.S. Mill, David Walker,
Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Marx, Darwin, Nietzsche, Du Bois,
Gandhi, Ambedkar, Fanon, Arendt, Foucault, the Combahee
River Collective, Barbara Fields, Sadiya Hartman, Dipesh
Chakrabarty, Kyle Powys White, as well as the Bible and The
Qur'an.

HUMA UN1121 “Art Humanities’’ has been a degree
requirement for all College students and an integral part of
the Core Curriculum since 1947. It helps students develop
their visual literacy through looking at, thinking about, and
engaging in critical discussion of the visual arts. It is not a
historical survey, but an analytical study of a limited number
of monuments and artists. The course focuses on the formal
structure of works of architecture, sculpture, painting, and
other media, as well as the historical contexts in which these
works were made and understood. Among the topics on
the syllabus are the Parthenon, Cordoba Mosque-Cathedral
and Amiens Cathedral, and works by Raphael, Sofonisba,
Anguissola, Michelangelo, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Luisa Roldán,
Rembrandt van Rijn, Clara Peeters, Jacques-Louis David,
Angelica Kauffman, Francisco Goya, Claude Monet, Edouard
Manet, Mary Cassatt, Berthe Morisot, Pablo Picasso, Romare
Bearden, Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Andy Warhol,
Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Cindy Sherman. In addition to
discussion-based class meetings, all sections of Art Humanities
make extensive use of the vast resources of New York City
through field trips to museums, buildings, and monuments.
Registration Procedure

Prof. Benjamin Steege
bas39@columbia.edu
Music Humanities Website
The focus of Music Humanities is on the many forms of the
Western musical imagination in art music, through works
studied in their historical and cultural contexts. The specific
goals of the course are to awaken and encourage active,
critical, and comparative listening practices, to provide tools to
respond verbally to a variety of musical idioms, and to create
engagement with the debates about the character and purposes of
music that have occupied composers and musical thinkers since
ancient times. The extraordinary richness of musical life in New
York is an integral part of the course.
The course moves chronologically from the Middle Ages to the
present, examining the choices and assumptions of composers,
their patrons, audiences, and performers, and exploring what
we can and can’t know about how music of the past may have
sounded. Students’ critical perceptions and articulate responses
to the music, and to the source readings that are a hallmark of
the Core, will be a vital part of the class.

FRONTIERS OF SCIENCE-DISC is a one-semester course that
integrates modern science into the Core Curriculum. The course
includes lectures and seminar sections. On Mondays throughout
the semester, each of Columbia’s leading scientists present
a mini-series of lectures. During the rest of the week, senior
faculty and Columbia post-doctoral science fellows (research
scientists selected for their teaching abilities) lead seminar
sections limited to twenty-two students to discuss the lecture
and its associated readings, and to debate the implications of the
most recent scientific discoveries. Frontiers of Science satisfies
one of the three required courses of the science requirement for
Columbia College.

Exemption from Music
Humanities
Although all Columbia students are expected to take Music
Humanities, there are some students who enter with exceptional
musical backgrounds that may qualify them for exemption.
Exemption from Music Humanities may be obtained by passing
an Exemption Exam. In the case of transfer students, exemption
may also be obtained by filing a course substitution request.
All information concerning registration in SCNC CC1000
FRONTIERS OF SCIENCE is included in the registration
materials sent to students. All first-year students are
preregistered in Frontiers of Science. Prospective science majors
may petition the Committee on Science Instruction to be allowed
to postpone taking Frontiers of Science until their sophomore
year, if they are enrolled in the following courses during their
first-year in the College:
1. Literature Humanities (HUMA CC1001);
2. A mathematics course;
3. A language course at the elementary II level or above;
4. One of the following science major sequences:
CHEM UN2045
& CHEM UN2046
Exemption Exam
The Exemption Exam is offered on the first Friday of the fall
semester by the Music Department (621 Dodge Hall). Students
who matriculate in the spring semester should take the exam in
the following fall term. Students may take the exam only once
during their first year at Columbia. If they do not pass the exam,
they must enroll in a section of Music Humanities.
PHYS UN1601
& PHYS UN1602
PHYS UN2801
& PHYS UN2802
Course Substitution
In addition to the Exemption Exam, students with approved
transfer credit have the option of requesting exemption on the
basis of a similar music course passed with a grade of B or
higher at another college or university. This exemption must
be requested during the student’s first semester at Columbia.
Petitions submitted in subsequent semesters will not be
considered by the Center for the Core Curriculum.

Science, must be taken for a letter grade. Students may not
drop or withdraw from Frontiers of Science after the Core drop
deadline (which is also the end of the Change-of-Program period
(p. 4)). For more information, see Registration—Dropping Core

Foreign Language
Requirement
General Information:
109Foreign Language Requirement
Academic Affairs
cc-academic@columbia.edu
The Foreign Language Requirement Website
The foreign language requirement forms part of Columbia
College’s mission to prepare students to be tomorrow’s
conscientious and informed citizens. Knowledge of another’s
language and literature is the most important way to begin to
know a country and people. The study of a foreign language:
1. Introduces students to world cultures, also making them
aware of their own culture within that context;
2. Informs students of the differences in structure, grammar,
and syntax that distinguish languages from each other, and
clarifies the intimate links between language and cultural
meaning;
3. Contributes to the development of students’ critical,
analytical, and writing skills.
The requirement may be satisfied in one of the following ways:
1. Satisfactory completion of the second term of an
intermediate language sequence.
2. Demonstration of an equivalent competence through the
appropriate score on the SAT II Subject Test or Advanced
Placement Tests.
3. Demonstration of an equivalent competence through the
College’s own placement tests (consult the department
through which the language is offered).
4. The successful completion of an advanced level foreign
language or literature course that requires 2102 or the
equivalent as a prerequisite. This course must be taken for a
letter grade.
5. Students whose native language is not English are not
required to take an additional foreign language or an
achievement test if they have completed the secondary
school requirement in the native language.
Because success in learning a foreign language is dependent
on the full engagement of the students enrolled in a language
course, all terms of language instruction/conversation courses,
whether being used toward fulfillment of the foreign language
requirement or not, must be taken in order and for a letter grade.
These courses may not be taken for a grade of Pass/D/Fail.
Students wishing to satisfy the requirement in any other
language should consult with their advising dean. In some
instances, equivalent language courses offered at Barnard
College and in the School of General Studies may be used to
satisfy the requirement, however, students should speak with the
Columbia department to ensure that courses from these schools
are approved for the requirement.
Any student who wishes to submit a language course taken at
another institution in fulfillment of the language requirement
must pass a departmental placement examination.
In order to ensure that students achieve foreign-language
proficiency without a significant break in progress, this
requirement must be completed before a student can be eligible
to study abroad, even if the language of instruction of the study-
abroad program is English. For students seeking to study abroad
in other languages, more advanced foreign-language study is
usually required (see Special Programs).
The following languages are offered in the College toward
satisfaction of the requirement:

Global Core
Requirement
Committee on Global Core
globalcore@columbia.edu
General Information, Academic Affairs
cc-academic@columbia.edu
Global Core Requirement Website
The Global Core requirement asks students to engage directly
with the variety of civilizations and the diversity of traditions
that, along with the West, have formed the world and continue to
interact in it today. Courses in the Global Core typically explore
the cultures of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and the Middle East
in an historical context. These courses are organized around a set
of primary materials produced in these traditions and may draw
from texts or other forms of media, as well as from oral sources
or performance, broadly defined.
Global Core courses fall into two categories, and can be, on
occasion, a hybrid of the two types: those with a comparative,
multidisciplinary, or interdisciplinary focus on specific cultures
or civilizations, tracing their existence across a significant
span of time, and may include Europe and/or the U.S.; and
those that address a common theme or set of analytic questions
comparatively (and may include Europe and the U.S.). The
Global Core requirement consists of courses that examine
areas not the primary focus of Literature Humanities and
Contemporary Civilization and that, like other Core courses, are
broadly introductory, interdisciplinary, and temporally and/or
spatially expansive.
Students must complete two courses from the approved list of
Global Core courses for a letter grade.
Global Core Navigator
The Global Core Navigator is a sortable list which allows
students to search for approved Global Core courses based on
academic approach, region, temporal period, and academic
department.

Science Requirement
General Information: Academic Affairs, cosi@columbia.edu
The objective of the science component of Columbia College’s
Core Curriculum is identical to that of its humanities and social
science counterparts, namely to help students “to understand
the civilization of their own day and to participate effectively in
it.” The science component is intended specifically to provide
students with the opportunity to learn what kinds of questions
are asked about nature, how hypotheses are tested against
experimental or observational evidence, how results of tests are
evaluated, and what knowledge has been accumulated about the
workings of the natural world.
All students in Columbia College must complete three
courses in fulfillment of the science requirement. The three
courses must be distributed across the three categories
detailed below: Science A, Science B, and Science C.
Each of the three courses must carry at least 3 points of
credit. All courses used to satisfy the science requirement
must be taken for a letter grade.
Students should pay careful attention to the prerequisites and
instructor approvals required for certain courses. Prerequisite
and instructor approval requirements can be found in the course
descriptions for each course located in specific departments'
sections of this bulletin.
While students are not required to complete a two-term
sequence, students may choose to do so, if the two courses
together will fulfill both Science B and Science C. For this
reason, the Committee on Science Instruction has indicated
recommended sequences below. Unless otherwise noted, the first
course in the sequence must be taken before the second course in
the sequence.
Transfer students may be able to apply transfer credit for
science coursework taken elsewhere to the Science requirement.
One of the three required science courses must be taken at
Columbia, and the coursework taken to fulfill the three-semester
science requirement must be distributed across the categories of
Science B and Science C.
Unless otherwise indicated, students may not use Barnard
College courses to fulfill the Columbia College science
requirement.
Science A
Students who enter the College as first-year students are required
to take SCNC CC1000 Frontiers of Science during their first or
second semester (whichever term in which they are not taking
ENGL CC1010 University Writing)
123Science Requirement
Science B
All College students must complete at least one course offered
by one of the following seven Columbia University science
departments. (Unless otherwise indicated, students may not use
Barnard College courses to fulfill the Columbia College science
requirement.)
Courses in the list that are designed for non-science majors are
noted with an asterisk.

Physical Education
Requirement
General Information
Physical Education Department
Dodge Physical Fitness Center
212-854-3439
Physical Education Website
All Columbia College students must complete a two-semester
Physical Education requirement and pass a swim test in order to
graduate.
Students may register for only one Physical Education course
in a single semester. Students may elect to take additional
semesters of Physical Education for academic credit after the
minimum requirement of 2 credits has been fulfilled, up to a
maximum of 4 points of credit for Physical Education courses
that can count towards the B.A. degree.
Dance courses at Barnard College can be taken to fulfill the two-
semester Physical education requirement.
Grades for Physical Education courses are generally based
on attendance and participation. To pass a course, students
must fulfill the attendance and participation requirements
outlined by each section and available on the physical education
website. Students who are absent more than the permissible
number of times are withdrawn from the course, unless they
complete and file a drop form by the official deadline to drop
a course.
If students will miss a class meeting in order to observe a major
religious holiday, they are responsible for arranging make-up
classes with the instructor or departmental representative prior to
the holiday.
The Swim Test Requirement
The swim test requirement can be fulfilled either by passing a
swim test or by taking a one-semester PHED swimming course
for beginners.
Students may request a waiver for the swim test for reasons
of disability or for reasons of religious observance. A waiver
related to a disability that precludes swimming must be certified
by Columbia Health. A waiver related to religious observance
that precludes swimming must be approved by the director of
the Physical Education program. All requests for waivers and
accommodations are reviewed by the director of the Physical
Education program.
For a list of summer courses approved for the science
requirement, students should consult the annually updated List
of Approved Summer Courses.
127Physical Education Requirement
Intercollegiate Athletics
Intercollegiate Athletes and the Physical
Education and Swim Test Requirement
To fulfill the two-semester Physical Education requirement,
a rostered student-athlete who intends to participate in an
intercollegiate sport should register for the appropriate section
of PHED UN1005 INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS.
Intercollegiate athletes may earn up to 4 points of credit of
PHED UN1005 toward the degree.
Student-athletes who leave the team in mid-term but still wish
to receive academic credit must notify the Physical Education
Office and be placed in another physical education course to
complete the attendance requirement.
Student-athletes are responsible for fulfilling the swim
requirement according to the guidance noted above.
Eligibility for Intercollegiate Athletics
Any student in the College who is pursuing the undergraduate
program or a combined program toward a first degree is eligible
for intercollegiate athletics. To be eligible for athletic activities,
the student must make appropriate progress toward the degree
as defined by the NCAA, the Ivy League, and Columbia
University. These criteria are monitored by the Center for
Student Advising and certified by the Office of the Registrar.
Questions about athletic eligibility should be referred to the
appropriate advising dean or the compliance office in the
Department of Intercollegiate Athletics and Physical Education.
For more information, visit www.gocolumbialions.com.
128ACADEMIC
REGULATIONS
Attendance in Courses
Attendance in all class meetings, laboratory periods and other
required events for a course is a basic expectation of all students
enrolled in the course, whether or not attendance is noted as a
requirement on a course syllabus.
Instructors may take attendance into account in assessing a
student’s performance in a course. In many courses, particularly
those with the requirement of regular participation, multiple
absences could lead to a failing grade for the course, even before
the conclusion of the semester.
Students are accountable for absences that result from enrolling
in a course after the semester begins.
For related information about attendance, see Columbia
University Policies—Religious Holidays.
Points of Credit per Term
Every Columbia College student must complete 124 points of
academic credit to earn the B.A. degree from Columbia College.
To complete this number of credits over 8 semesters, students
will need to complete an average of 15.5 credits per semester,
which typically represents 4 to 5 academic courses (each of 3 or
more credits) per term.
A student’s “academic program” is the full complement of
courses in which the student is registered in an academic term–
the combination of subjects, topics, and credits that a student
plans to complete in a given semester.
A full-time course load is defined as an academic program
carrying 12-18 points per semester.
• All Columbia College students are required to be full-time
students and must therefore be registered for a minimum of
12 points of credit per term. Columbia College students are
not permitted to enroll as part-time students.
• Any student who has not registered for at least 12 points
of credit by the end of the Change of Program period may
be withdrawn from Columbia College.
• An exception to this policy can be made for students
in their final term who need fewer than 12 points of
credit to complete their degree requirements, with the
understanding that they will still be viewed as full-time
students and will be responsible for full-time tuition and
fees and for all other rules that apply to full-time students.
Students in this scenario may petition the Committee on
Academic Standing to register for fewer than 12 points
and should consult with their advising deans in the Berick
Center for Student Advising. If they are approved to
take fewer than 12 points of credit, they will still be
considered full-time students of Columbia College and be
responsible for all relevant tuition and fees.
• Students may not enroll in more than 18 points of credit
unless they petition the Committee on Points in the Berick
Center for Student Advising and receive permission to do so.
• Students in their first semester at Columbia (i.e., first-
year students and new transfer students in their first
semester) may not petition to register for more than 18
points.
Length of Candidacy
Students are expected to earn the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)
degree at Columbia College in eight Fall and Spring
semesters.
Students may continue to take required coursework for the
B.A. degree past the eighth semester only with permission from
the Committee on Academic Standing, after first discussing
such requests with their advising deans in the Berick Center
for Student Advising. Study beyond the eighth term is granted
only for students who have found themselves in emergent
circumstances beyond their control which have prevented them
from completing the degree in eight terms.
Note: Study beyond the eighth term is not granted for the
purposes of changing a major or of completing a second
program of study (e.g., a minor, special program, or second
major).
Progress Toward the Degree
At the end of each Fall and Spring semester, the Committee on
Academic Standing reviews the records of all students enrolled
in Columbia College to determine whether students are in good
academic standing or whether academic action is warranted—
including academic warning, academic probation, suspension
and dismissal.
Good Academic Standing
To be considered in good academic standing, students achieve
the following in each academic term:
• Complete a minimum of 12 points of credit of academic
coursework;
• Achieve a term minimum grade point average of 2.0 (a “C”
average);
• Achieve a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (a “C”
average);
• Make expected progress in the required Core Curriculum
courses;
Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025Academic Regulations
• Make expected progress in the coursework toward a declared
major; and
• Make adequate progress in the number of cumulative credits
required to be earned in eight semesters–i.e., the minimum of
124 credits for the Bachelor of Arts degree.
• Students are expected to complete their degrees in eight
semesters. Students who do not make adequate progress
toward the degree may be placed on academic probation.
• Adequate progress toward the degree is defined according
to cumulative earned credits, as noted by the number
of credits listed in the column of the chart below titled
“Threshold for Academic Probation.”:

Academic Warning and Probation
Students may be placed on academic warning for the
following reasons:
• earning a term grade point average of 2.0, or just over 2.0,
such that there is concern that the student may lose good
academic standing if performance does not improve.
• earning a cumulative grade point average of 2.0, or just over
2.0, such that there is concern that the student may lose good
academic standing if performance does not improve.
Students may also be placed on academic warning for
completing fewer cumulative points than expected for the
number of terms completed at Columbia College, such that
it will be difficult for the student to complete the degree in
eight semesters. Students in this situation should still be able to
graduate in eight semesters without having to take more than the
maximum of 18 points of coursework per semester.
The action of academic warning does not remain on a student’s
record.
Students may be placed on academic probation for the
following reasons:
• completing fewer than the required minimum of 12 points of
credit in a term;
• earning a term grade point average average below 2.0;
• earning a cumulative grade point average average below 2.0;
• failing a Core Curriculum class; or
• failing to complete Frontiers of Science, Literature
Humanities (both semesters), or University Writing in their
first year.
Students may also be placed on academic probation for failing to
make satisfactory progress toward the degree, according to the
thresholds noted in the table above.
Students who are on academic probation are not eligible to study
abroad.
The action of academic probation remains on a student’s record
for internal use only. The status of academic probation is not
noted on students’ transcripts.
Students may not appeal the actions of academic warning or
academic probation.
Students and parents/guardians are notified when students are
placed on academic probation. The advising deans in the Berick
Center for Student Advising provide support to help students
who are on academic action return to good standing.
Academic Suspension/Dismissal
Students who fail to improve after being on academic probation,
as well as students with extremely poor records during a
single term, may be suspended and required to withdraw
from Columbia College for at least one year. Conditions for
readmission are specified at the time of suspension. If a student
is readmitted after having been suspended and again fails to
achieve satisfactory grades or to make normal progress toward
the degree, the student may be dismissed from the College.
Students are notified by email and express mail of the actions
of suspension or dismissal, and they will have a limited time in
which to appeal the decision.
The decision of the appeals committee is final.
The actions of academic suspension or academic dismissal
remain on students’ records and are recorded on the students’
transcripts.
Parents and/or guardians are notified when students are
suspended or dismissed for academic reasons.
International students with F-1 or J-1 status are not allowed to
remain in the United States while suspended or dismissed from
the University. Any international student who is dismissed or
suspended should immediately contact the International Students
and Scholars Office (ISSO) to discuss available options.
Graduation
The B.A. degree can be awarded three times during the year: in
February, in May, and in October. Under special circumstances,
a B.A. degree scheduled to be awarded in May may be awarded
in June instead.
130Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Columbia College holds its Class Day exercises in May. This
ceremony is presided over by the Dean of Columbia College,
and each graduating senior is individually acknowledged and
congratulated by the Dean.
The University holds its Commencement ceremony for
all schools of Columbia University in May (see Academic
Calendar). This ceremony is presided over by the President
of Columbia University, and the President officially confers
the Bachelor of Arts degree upon all students graduating from
Columbia College.
Application or Renewal of Application for the
Degree
In order to receive the Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia
College, students who are on track to complete all requirements
for the degree must apply for the degree.
General deadlines for applying for graduation are September
1 for October degrees; November 1 for February degrees;
and December 1 for May degrees. When a deadline falls on a
weekend or holiday, the deadline moves to the next business
day.
The application for the degree is available on the Registrar's
website. Students may complete the degree application form
electronically and submit it to diplomas@columbia.edu.
Alternative instructions for submitting the application for the
degree are noted on the form.
Students who fail to earn the degree by the conferral date for
which they applied must file another application for a later
conferral date.
Diplomas
Diplomas are mailed to students after the degree has been
officially conferred. There is no charge for the preparation and
conferral of an original diploma. Students’ names will be printed
exactly as they appear on their transcript. Students are advised
to check their transcript and email the Office of the University
Registrar at registrar@columbia.edu if corrections are needed.
If students wish to change the name noted on the transcript, they
must submit the Name Change Affidavit. The affidavit must be
notarized and filed by the deadline to submit the application for
degree.
If a graduate’s Columbia diploma is lost or damaged, there
will be a charge of $100 for a replacement diploma. Note that
replacement diplomas carry the signatures of current University
officials. Applications for replacement diplomas are available
through the Office of the University Registrar.

Regulations for Transfer
Students
All academic regulations noted in this Bulletin apply to students
who transfer into Columbia College as sophomores or as juniors,
with the following special considerations for their status as
transfer students:
Transfer Credit toward the Degree
Every Columbia College student must complete 124 points of
academic credit to earn the B.A. degree from Columbia College.
In order to receive the Columbia College degree, transfer
students must complete a minimum of 60 points while enrolled
in the College - which can include credits earned on Columbia-
sponsored study abroad programs.
Transfer students may apply a maximum of 64 points taken
elsewhere toward advanced standing at the College. Credit
granted on the basis of Advanced Placement, International
Baccalaureate and other standardized examinations is counted
toward the 64-point maximum, as are credits earned at Columbia
in the summer prior to matriculation and on study-abroad
programs outside of Columbia. Credit is not granted for college
courses taken while in high school.
Transfer students receive credit for non-Columbia courses that
are substantially similar to Columbia College courses only when
the grades received are C- or better. Once a transfer student is
admitted, a credit review is conducted by the Berick Center for
Student Advising and a tentative credit evaluation is sent to the
student. A final credit evaluation is conducted once the student
has matriculated at Columbia College and has submitted a final
official transcript for coursework taken elsewhere.
Class standing for students transferring to Columbia College is
determined prior to matriculation and is based on the number
of terms and credits completed at the home institution. Twelve
credits is the equivalent of one full-time term. A transfer
student's class standing will remain in place for the duration
of the student's time in Columbia College, regardless of
future credits earned. Once they have matriculated, transfer
students may be assigned additional advanced standing like
Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and other
standardized examination credit, but their class status will
remain the same. This policy remains in place even when
students are eligible to graduate in less than eight terms.
Transfer Credit toward Academic
Requirements
Course descriptions and syllabi may be requested by Columbia
College in order for certain courses to be considered for transfer
credit and/or for certain courses to be considered for exemption
to Columbia College requirements. Transfer students should
131Academic Regulations
consult with their advising deans in the Berick Center for
Student Advising, where all appropriate approvals will be
coordinated with the relevant academic departments.personal emergency (with notice given to the instructor as early
as possible). Travel plans should be scheduled for dates that fall
on holidays or on weekends.
The Core Curriculum is the cornerstone of undergraduate
academic life at Columbia. Even those transferring in with
advanced credit should expect to take most of the coursework
in the Core Curriculum, if not all of it. Students are very
rarely exempt from the shared Core classes like Literature
Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Art Humanities and
Music Humanities.Final Examinations
Degree Completion
Transfer students are expected to complete the requirements
for the B.A. degree in eight undergraduate Fall and Spring
semesters, inclusive of terms completed at other colleges or
universities before entering Columbia. Transfer students
cannot petition for extended time to complete the degree.
Some majors may be difficult for transfer students to complete
due to the number of credits required, the specific course
sequencing, and the number of terms remaining for transfer
students to complete all requirements for the Core Curriculum
and for the major. There is no guarantee that a transfer student
can complete every major offered. Transfer students must
declare a major that they are capable of completing in the time
available to them while at Columbia College.
Final examinations are given at the end of each term. During the
first weeks of a Fall or Spring term, the Registrar’s Office issues
a Projected University Examination Schedule which presents
the likely schedule of final examinations for the semester. The
Registrar’s Office will then issue the definitive University-wide
Final Exam Schedule typically in early to mid-November for a
Fall term and early to mid-April for a Spring term.
Final exams missed for travel are not excused. Travel plans
should be scheduled for dates that fall on holidays, on weekends,
or after final exams. Students should wait to confirm plans to
leave campus for winter break until they have confirmation of
their weekly course schedule (including discussion sections and
labs) and of their final exam schedule, in order to ensure that
they will be present for all final exams.
Students can view the Projected University Examination
Schedule and the University-wide Final Exam Schedule in
their Student Services Online (SSOL) accounts by clicking on
"Schedule," then "My Exam Schedule.” Students who have
trouble locating a class on either list should contact the instructor
to make sure the class has an exam.
Study beyond the eighth term is not granted for the purposes of
changing a major or of completing a second program of study
(i.e., a minor or a special program or a second major).Rescheduling Final Exams
• Instructor Final Exam Conflicts
Transfer students should be especially careful when planning
their academic schedules and are strongly urged to seek out
guidance from their advising deans in the Berick Center for
Student Advising and the relevant departmental Directors of
Undergraduate Studies.Under certain rare circumstances, it may be necessary for an
instructor to reschedule a final exam. Any change to the day or
time assigned by the Master University Examination Schedule
must be agreed upon by the instructor and the students enrolled
in the class. All students unable to take the exam at the new
agreed-upon time must be given a make-up exam at a time that
they are able to attend.
Examinations
Midterm Examinations
Midterm examinations are given during the course of each term.
Although the term “midterm exam” might suggest one exam
that occurs halfway through the term, a midterm exam can be
given anytime between the beginning and the end of the term.
Midterm examinations are scheduled by each instructor, based
on the pedagogical structure of a course. Therefore, while many
midterm exams may be scheduled around the midpoint of a term
(e.g., late October or mid-March), midterm exams may also fall
earlier or later in the term (what we might call instead a “term-
time exam”), and a course may require multiple exams during
the course of the semester. Students should consult the syllabus
of each course in which they are registered for the schedule of
required midterm exams.
Midterm exams missed for travel are not excused, unless the
travel is approved by Athletics for a Varsity athletics team (with
advance notice given to the instructor) or if the travel is for a
• Student Final Exam Conflicts
Students may request a change of schedule for a final exam
under either of the following two circumstances:
1.
if a student is enrolled in two or more classes whose final
exams are scheduled by the Master University Examination
Schedule to be held at the same time; and/or
2.
if a student has three exams scheduled on any given
calendar day (i.e., between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. on the same
calendar date).
Students in either circumstance should meet with their advising
deans in the Berick Center for Student Advising as soon as
possible after the final exam schedule is published in order to
initiate the process for arranging a make-up exam.
132Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Failure to Complete a Final Exam
AR YC
If a student does not take a final exam, or begins but does not
complete a final exam, a grade of zero or F may be factored for
that portion of the final grade. Make-up examinations are not
guaranteed for any student who does not take or does not finish a
final exam.
Incompletes
Students facing medical, personal, or family emergencies at
the time of a final exam or at the due date of a final paper or
project may petition the Committee on Academic Standing
for permission to complete the final exam, paper, or project
at a later date. Students will receive a temporary mark of IN
(Incomplete) until the work is completed. For more information,
see the Grades section of this Bulletin.
Grades
A temporary mark submitted by
an instructor for the Fall term
grade in a continuous year-
long course. When the final
grade is calculated at the end of
the academic year, the ARYC
should be changed to a grade
so that the Fall and Spring
grades for the two semesters
are identical.
Report of Grades
Grades are available to view on SSOL on the first business day
after they are submitted by the instructor. Paper and electronic
transcripts may be ordered via SSOL. Students who find
discrepancies in, or have questions about their records should
contact their academic advisor.
The grading system used by Columbia College is as follows:Grade Point Average Calculation
A+, A, A-
B+, B, B-
C+, C, C-

external purposes, such as official transcripts. The Registrar also
calculates term and cumulative grade point averages for internal
purposes, such as determining eligibility for the Dean’s List.
Excellent

Other notations may appear on
students' transcripts as well:

the Pass/D/Fail grading option
for the course. Restrictions on
this option are detailed below.
W

course, initiated by the student.
The deadline to withdraw from
a course varies among the
undergraduate schools.
Additionally, the following
notations can be used by
instructors for students of
Columbia College or General
Studies:
AR
A temporary mark submitted
by an instructor if a student
is experiencing extraordinary
circumstances and more time
is needed to determine the final

When the Registrar computes a student’s Columbia College
grade point average, only grades earned while enrolled in
Columbia College in the Fall and Spring terms (including
Columbia-owned study abroad programs) and in Columbia-
owned summer programs (including the Columbia School of
Professional Studies Summer Sessions and Columbia-owned
summer study abroad programs) are counted. Courses are
weighted according to the number of credits.

The Pass/D/Fail Option
The purposes of the Pass/D/Fail option are to encourage students
to take courses of interest to them outside of their field of
specialization and to permit those who have not decided upon
a major to test their talents in a particular field that may be of
interest.
133Academic Regulations
The Pass/D/Fail option cannot be utilized for courses taken
in fulfillment of the Core Curriculum or, for the most part,
for courses taken in fulfillment of a major. Students can
use the Pass/D/Fail option for elective coursework and, in a
few cases, for the introductory course in a major or minor (see
departmental guidelines for details).a grade of D may be used to satisfy the requirements for a major
or minor is made by the director of undergraduate studies of the
relevant department or program.
Students elect the Pass/D/Fail option for a course through their
SSOL accounts, and students can select or deselect the Pass/D/
Fail option up until the deadline that occurs on the last day of
classes of a Fall or Spring term.The Mark of W (Withdrawal)
• Instructors assign all students in their class letter grades.
Instructors are not informed if a student in their class elects
to use the Pass/D/Fail option for the class.
• If a student has elected the Pass/D/Fail option for a class and
receives a letter grade of C- or higher in the course, the letter
grade will be covered by a mark of P. The mark of P is not
included in the calculation of grade point averages.
• If a student has elected the Pass/D/Fail option for a class and
receives a letter grade of D or F, the D or F remains on the
transcript and is included in the calculation of grade point
averages.
In order to encourage students to engage fully in the courses they
elect to take for a grade of Pass/D/Fail, students are allowed to
uncover a grade of P in SSOL until the end of the Change of
Program period of the following semester.
• Students have until the end of the Change of Program period
in the Spring semester to uncover the grade of a course taken
in the previous Fall term, and until the end of the change of
program period in the Fall semester to uncover the grade of a
course taken in the previous Spring or Summer term.
• Seniors who graduate in May have until June 1 to uncover
the grade of a course taken in their final Spring semester.
• Students who wish to uncover a grade of P can do so during
these time periods through their SSOL accounts.
The Grade of D
As noted above, the grade of D is considered “poor but
passing”--i.e., poor understanding of the course material and
therefore unsatisfactory progress in the curriculum. Therefore,
no more than six points of credit earned with the grade of D
may be credited toward the degree in any academic year – the
academic year being inclusive of the Fall, Spring, and Summer
terms. No more than 12 points of credit earned with the grade of
D may be cumulatively credited toward the 124 credits required
for the degree credit. These credits will be given only for courses
taken at Columbia; transfer credit will not be awarded for
courses taken elsewhere with a grade of D.
In general, courses completed with a grade of D will not count
toward a major or minor. The decision of whether a course with
In any given semester, the grade of D precludes the attainment
of Dean’s List status (see Academic Honors, Prizes, and
Fellowships—Dean's List).
Students may drop a course from their academic programs
by the fifth week of a Fall or Spring term, as long as they
remain registered in a minimum of 12 points of coursework. If a
student drops a course under these conditions, the course will be
removed from the student’s transcript.
After the drop deadline and until the Monday of the last full
week of classes of a Fall or Spring term, if a student has a
compelling reason to stop taking a course, the student can
withdraw from the course. If a student withdraws from a course,
the course will remain on the student’s transcript with a mark
of W, indicating official withdrawal from that course after the
drop deadline. This notation is permanent and will remain on
the transcript even if the student repeats the course. No points of
academic credit are earned for classes with a mark of W.
Students must complete a minimum of 12 points of coursework
in a term to be considered in good academic standing. If a
student withdraws from a course and then completes fewer
than 12 credits, the student may face academic action, such as
academic probation, suspension, or dismissal. Students who do
not make adequate progress toward the degree – i.e., an average
of 15.5 points per term – may also face academic probation,
suspension, or dismissal.
It is therefore important for students to consult their advising
deans when considering the option of withdrawing from a
course. If the option to withdraw still seems to be the best course
of action, students should submit a completed Columbia College
Acknowledgement of Course Withdrawal form to their advising
deans. A withdrawal will be official only after these steps are
taken; failure to attend classes does not constitute dropping or
withdrawing from a course, nor does a student's communication
to the instructor of intent to withdraw. Students who stop
attending classes without dropping or officially withdrawing are
assigned the letter grade earned by factoring a zero or F for any
missing work.
In any given semester, the mark of W precludes the attainment
of Dean’s List status (see Academic Honors, Prizes, and
Fellowships—Dean's List).
The Mark of AR (Administrative Referral)
The AR is a temporary notation for the transcript when an
instructor needs additional time and/or additional consultation
in order to determine a student’s final grade for a course. The
instructor should then consult the student's advising dean in
the Berick Center for Student Advising, for help in determining
134Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
an appropriate final grade. The instructor has ultimate authority
over the final grade awarded.Questions about incompletes may be directed to the advising
deans in the Berick Center for Student Advising.
The AR notation is also used while a student applies for an
Incomplete. If the Incomplete is approved, the instructor will
submit a mark of AR for the student.The Mark of R (Registration Credit)
The Mark of IN (Incomplete)
The IN is a temporary notation for the transcript approved by
the Committee on Academic Standing for students who, due
to serious extenuating circumstances, cannot complete their
coursework or are unable to take a final examination by the end
of the term. An IN is typically granted only in cases of severe
illness (as certified by a healthcare practitioner or by Columbia
Health) or extreme personal or family emergencies.
Students may not arrange unofficial incompletes or
extended deadlines simply through consultation with their
instructors; any incomplete must be officially approved by
the Committee on Academic Standing.
• Students will be granted an IN only by first speaking with
their advising deans and then filing a petition with the
Committee on Academic Standing. Petition forms are
available in the Berick Center for Student Advising.
• To be granted an IN, students should have completed
all work for the relevant class with the exception of the
final paper, project or exam. If a student has additional
uncompleted work in the class in addition to the final paper,
project, or exam, an IN may not be granted.
• For classes that require a final paper or project, petitions
must be submitted no later than the last day of classes. For
classes that require a final examination, petitions must be
submitted no later than the day before the exam.
If an instructor is willing to entertain an incomplete, pending
approval by the Committee on Academic Standing, the
instructor should submit a temporary grade of AR, along with
a contingency grade that represents the grade that the student
would earn if the final grade were calculated at the time of grade
submissions–i.e., the grade that the student would earn if the
missing work were included in the calculation with a zero.
Students who are granted an IN are assigned a deadline for
completion of the incomplete paper or project or a date by which
a deferred examination must be taken. Those who fail to meet
the assigned deadline or who miss the deferred examination
will receive the contingency grade indicated by the instructor.
All other marks of IN that remain unresolved by the end of one
calendar year will be converted to the contingency grade or will
be converted to a grade of F.
Students who receive the grade of IN, approved in advance by
the Committee on Academic Standing, may be considered for
Dean’s List only after all IN grades are changed to letter grades
(see Academic Honors, Prizes, and Fellowships—Dean's List).
The mark of R (Registration Credit) is given when a student,
with the approval of the course instructor and the Committee
on Academic Standing, regularly attends and participates in a
course without the requirement to submit work for evaluation
(i.e., auditing a course).
The R credit option is available only to Columbia College
seniors under the following conditions:
1. The course(s) will be taken in the last two terms of the
student’s attendance in Columbia College.
2. The course(s) will not count toward the 124 points of credit
required for the Bachelor of Arts degree.
3. The course(s) will not fulfill a requirement of the Core
Curriculum or a requirement of a major or a minor or a
special program.
4. The student has the permission of the instructor of the course
and the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing.
There may be additional conditions set by the course instructor,
who may wish to require the completion of a certain type or
amount of work in order to earn the R credit. The exact nature of
any required coursework should be determined by the instructor
when the student petitions for an R for the course. An instructor
may give a grade of F to a student who has not completed this
required work.
The deadline for registering for R credit is the same deadline
as the deadline to drop any course that is not part of the shared
Core Curriculum – i.e., the drop deadline that falls during the
fifth week of classes of a Fall or Spring term. Students should
consult the academic calendar in the Bulletin for the exact
deadline each term to register for R credit.
Courses taken for R credit do not receive any points of academic
credit, and they are not factored in the calculation of a student's
GPA.
The Mark of YC (Year Course)
The YC is a notation given at the end of the first term of a year-
long course in which the full year’s work must be completed
before a qualitative grade can be assigned. The YC notation for
the first term must be approved by the Berick Center for Student
Advising, so the instructor will submit a notation of AR[YC],
which will be converted to a YC upon request by the instructor.
The final grade given at the end of the second term of the year-
long course is the grade for the entire course; therefore, when
the final grade is assigned at the end of the second term, the
instructor should submit a request to change the YC for the
first term of the course to the same grade as that given in the
second term. In any given semester, the mark of YC precludes
the attainment of Dean's List status until the grade for the entire
135Academic Regulations
year's coursework is awarded (see Academic Honors, Prizes, and
Fellowships—Dean's List).Coursework Taken at Other
Colleges or Universities
Students may be able to receive credit toward the Columbia
College degree, and possibly advanced placement within
Columbia programs of study, through college-level work taken
before matriculating to Columbia College.Entering first-year students are not granted credit for courses
taken at other colleges or universities prior to their graduation
from secondary school.
The College grants credit for up to one semester of college-
level work (a maximum of 16 points) completed before
matriculation at Columbia College, subject to specific conditions
and guidelines.
• This credit could be awarded for exams taken during
secondary school, such as advanced-level examinations
such as College Board Advanced Placement examinations
(AP), Higher Level International Baccalaureate examinations
(IB), General Certificate of Education Advanced Level
examinations (A-Levels), or other national diploma
programs.
• This credit could also be awarded for courses taken at other
colleges or universities after the completion of secondary
school and before matriculation to Columbia.
• Whether the advanced credit is awarded for college-level
exams or college coursework or a combination thereof, the
maximum amount of credit that will be awarded is 16 points.
Academic credit toward the Bachelor of Arts from Columbia
College for this advanced-level work is awarded upon
completion of the first year at Columbia and is determined in
accordance with College and departmental policies. Students
wishing to arrange advanced credit must meet with their
advising dean in the Berick Center for Student Advising and
provide the relevant transcript or certification.
Students who wish to receive advanced credit in any academic
subject – including advanced placement in, or exemption from,
the language requirement – may not take courses at Columbia
that cover similar or more basic material than the advanced
work already completed. For example, students cannot receive
AP credit for a foreign language (which assumes a proficiency
at the same level as “Intermediate II” or similar level in a
language) and also take a class for credit in that language at the
“Intermediate II” level or lower. Also, students may not receive
credit for two exams that cover the same material (e.g., Calculus
AP and Mathematics GCE Advanced Level Exam).
In some cases, advanced credit is awarded only when students
successfully complete a higher-level course in the same field of
study.
For information about advanced standing for transfer students,
see Academic Regulations—Regulations for Transfer Students.
Entering first-year students may receive a maximum of 6
points of academic credit toward the Bachelor of Arts degree
from Columbia College for college courses taken after their
graduation from secondary school and prior to matriculation at
Columbia. In order to receive this credit, students must submit
for each relevant course taken elsewhere an official university
or college transcript and the syllabus of the course(s) to their
advising deans in the Berick Center for Student Advising. Final
determination will be made by the dean of advising.
Advanced Placement (AP)
Examinations
Students can earn up to a maximum of 16 points of academic
credit toward the Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia
College for College Board Advanced Placement (AP)
examinations with certain scores.
Note: Credit earned through AP scores cannot be used
toward exemption from any of the shared Core Curriculum
courses, the Global Core Requirement, or the Science
Requirement.
Credit earned through AP scores may be used toward
satisfying the Foreign Language Requirement, according to
the rules of the appropriate language department (see The Core
Curriculum—Foreign Language Requirement). Students who
wish to receive advanced credit toward, or exemption from, the
language requirement may not take courses at Columbia that
cover similar or more basic material than the advanced work
already completed.
Individual academic departments regularly review the
Advanced Placement curriculum and determine appropriate
placements, credit, and/or exemptions. Students should refer to
a department’s pages in this Bulletin (linked below) for specific
information on possible credits granted, possible advanced
placement, and possible course exemptions.

toward exemption from any of the shared Core Curriculum
courses, the Global Core Requirement, or the Science
Requirement.
For further information on the application of A-Levels credits,
students should consult with their advising dean in the Berick

Advanced Placement in
Language Study
Students who wish to begin foreign language studies at a level
above “Elementary I” (or its equivalent) may be placed into
a more advanced level based on placement exams taken at
Columbia or based on certain test scores on standardized tests.
Most language programs at Columbia will offer placement
exams for new students during the New Student Orientation
Program (NSOP). Exact times and dates of exams will be
provided to students shortly before NSOP begins. Returning
students who wish to take a placement exam but who are not
participating in NSOP should contact the relevant Columbia
language program before the beginning of each term to inquire
about opportunities to take a placement exam. Based on the
assessment of the placement exam, students may be placed into
a more advanced level of language study or may be exempted
from the Language requirement of the Core Curriculum.
It may also be possible for incoming first-year students to be
placed into upper levels of language study on the basis of scores
on the following tests:
• SAT II: Subject Tests
• Advanced Placement (AP) examinations
• Higher Level International Baccalaureate (IB) examinations
• Certain diplomas issued by national systems for college-level
curriculum
Individual departments regularly review the Advanced
Placement curriculum and determine appropriate placements,
credit, and/or exemptions; students should refer to a
department’s pages in this Bulletin for specific information
Credit earned through A-Levels scores may be used toward
satisfying the Foreign Language Requirement, according

on possible credits granted, advanced placement, and course
exemptions.courses will count as elective credit toward the 124 points
necessary for the B.A. degree.
In some cases, advanced credit/placement is awarded only when
students successfully complete a higher-level course in the same
foreign language.Columbia College students may also take courses in the
professional schools at Columbia University listed below for
credit that goes beyond the 124 points necessary for the B.A.
degree, if they receive permission to do so from their advising
deans from the Berick Center for Student Advising.
Students with scores on these exams should consult their
advising dean in the Berick Center for Student Advising and
should ensure that the scores have been sent through official
channels to Columbia College.

139Academic Regulations
Summer Study
Columbia Summer
Summer Study Outside Columbia University
Normally, students may earn credit toward the Bachelor of Arts
degree from Columbia College through summer coursework
only for courses taken in the Columbia Summer.In general, Columbia College students may not take courses
toward the Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia College
during the summer at another college or university outside
Columbia University, except in the case of approved study
abroad programs.
Columbia College students may enroll in a maximum of 8 points
of credit in any Columbia Summer session (or in overlapping
sessions), and may earn a maximum of 16 credits in any
Columbia Summer session.In some circumstances, permission may be granted to students to
take courses in the summer toward the Bachelor of Arts degree
from Columbia College during the summer at another college or
university. Those circumstances include the following:
Not all courses offered in the Summer Session are accepted
by Columbia College for credit. Students should consult their
advising dean in the Berick Center for Student Advising for
advice on which courses can be taken for credit, and students
should also consult the annually updated List of Approved
Summer Courses.• A student has fallen behind in credits and wishes to catch up
on coursework in order to make adequate progress toward the
degree in the expected eight Fall and Spring semesters.
The Columbia University School of Professional Studies (SPS)
is responsible for Columbia Summer, so students who take
courses in the Summer Session do so by enrolling directly in
SPS. Therefore, Columbia College students enrolled in Summer
Session courses offered by SPS are, during the course of their
enrollment in those summer courses, subject to the policies
and procedures of SPS, which may differ from the policies and
procedures that govern their undergraduate coursework in the
College in the Fall and Spring semesters. Columbia College
students interested in summer coursework should consult their
advising dean in the Berick Center for Student Advising for
information on the different policies and procedures governing
Columbia Summer.
Columbia College students enrolled in coursework in Columbia
Summer may utilize the Pass/D/Fail option only under the
following circumstances:
• Columbia College students may utilize the Pass/D/Fail option
a maximum of twice during a year that spans Fall, Spring,
and Summer. Students have the opportunity to use the Pass/
D/Fail option one time during the Fall semester and one time
during the Spring semester.
• Students who have not utilized one or both of these Pass/D/
Fail option(s) in the previous academic year may elect, in
the summer immediately following, to take one course in a
Summer session on a Pass/D/Fail basis.
• For additional information on and restrictions governing
Pass/D/Fail credit, see the Academic Regulations—Exams
and Grades section of this Bulletin.
Students who wish for summer coursework to count toward their
major or minor must receive permission from the director of
undergraduate studies of their major department.
• A student wishes to take a course that is a prerequisite for
a course that should be taken in the following fall for the
student’s major or minor.
• A student wishes to take a language course toward the
Foreign Language requirement. Students should note
that introductory and intermediate language courses are
only approved pending the successful completion of the
departmental placement test into the next higher level
language course. Students are responsible for arranging
departmental testing upon return to campus in the Fall. If
students do not place into the next level of the language
course, credit will not be granted. Students who elect to
discontinue study of the language or do not take the relevant
departmental placement test will not be granted credit for the
summer courses taken.
Students who wish to take summer coursework in one of the
above categories should discuss their study plans with their
advising dean in the Berick Center for Student Advising.
Students should then go through the following steps for approval
for summer coursework taken elsewhere:
1. Obtain a copy of Columbia College's Pre-Approval for a
Course Taken at Another U.S. Institution form, available in
the Berick Center for Student Advising.
2. Carefully read the following procedures to apply for such
credit.
3. Complete the approval request form, outlining their reasons
for taking summer courses and listing the specific courses in
which they wish to enroll.
4. Submit the completed approval request form to the advising
dean.
Once submitted to students' advising deans in the Berick Center
for Student Advising, the Committee on Academic Standing
reviews requests for approval. Students should secure pre-
approval prior to enrolling in courses at other institutions, to
140Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
avoid the loss of time and expense of enrolling in a course that is
ultimately not approved.
Students may not receive credits for study abroad during
the summer except in Columbia-sponsored programs or
approved foreign-language, archaeology, and field-studies
programs. Students seeking summer study abroad credits must
receive permission from the Center for Undergraduate Global
Engagement, 606 Kent.
Approval to receive College credit for summer school courses
does not ensure approval of the course to fulfill a Core
Curriculum requirement or a major or minor requirement.
• Students who wish for summer coursework to count toward
their major or minor must receive permission from the
director of undergraduate studies of their major department,
prior to taking the course.
• Students applying for summer school credit for courses
that they wish to use in partial fulfillment of the science or
Global Core requirements must submit the relevant course
approval petition to their advising dean in the Berick Center
for Student Advising for approval by the appropriate faculty
committee, prior to taking the course.
• For the Global Core requirement, only non-Columbia study
abroad courses taken in the Summer can be considered by
petition. Courses taken on Columbia’s campus must be pre-
approved by the Committee on the Global Core in order to
fulfill part of the Global Core requirement.
Study Outside Columbia
University in the Academic
Year
In general, Columbia College students may not take courses
for credit toward the Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia
College at another college or university during the academic
year (i.e., Fall or Spring). Permission to study at another school
for a term or a year is granted only for study at institutions
outside of the United States, as part of an approved study abroad
program, or for study through one of the established domestic
study-away programs. Exceptions may be granted for study
during the summer. See the Summer Study section for more
information.
Students may not be simultaneously enrolled at Columbia
College and at another institution of higher education. Students
who are enrolled at Columbia College yet matriculate into
another institution of higher education and/or are considered a
degree-seeking student at another college or university will be
withdrawn from Columbia with no opportunity to return and
complete the Columbia College degree.
Leaves of Absence and
Withdrawals from Columbia
College
Students can request a leave of absence prior to the start of a
term or during the term. When a student takes a leave of absence
during a term, this action is also considered a withdrawal,
defined as the dropping of one’s entire academic program in
a given term after the first day of classes of the term and, as a
result, withdrawing from Columbia College.
Withdrawing from Columbia College after the start of
the semester can have implications for financial aid, and
students are strongly advised to talk with their advising
deans and with the Office of Financial Aid about any
financial consequences of a necessary withdrawal.
Any student withdrawing from Columbia College must
notify the Berick Center for Student Advising in writing;
it is not sufficient for a withdrawal to notify instructors of
plans to withdraw or to stop attending classes. Absence from
classes without officially withdrawing from Columbia College
can result in failing grades in all courses.
Voluntary Medical Leave of
Absence
A medical leave is granted to a student whose health condition
interferes with successful full-time study. A leave can be granted
for a minimum of one term and a maximum of two years.
Unless a student is granted an exception due to extenuating
circumstances, a student will be permanently withdrawn after the
maximum time period of two years.
Students must consult with their advising deans in the Berick
Center for Student Advising to initiate a leave, and then provide
medical documentation to support the request. Medical leaves
must be accompanied by an individualized assessment of
students' individual healthcare needs.
While on leave, students must be actively engaged in a course
of medical treatment that leads to recovery. In addition, students
are required to continue to access their Columbia email, which is
the official means of communication by the University.
When applying for readmission to Columbia College,
students must provide medical documentation supporting
their readmission. Normally, students may only return in the
Fall or Spring term. Only in rare circumstances will students
be readmitted from medical leave to enroll in courses for the
Columbia Summer Session.
All questions about medical leaves should be addressed to
the students' advising deans in the Berick Center for Student
Advising.
141Academic Regulations
Academic Standing and Transcript Notations
Students who take a leave while in good academic standing will
return in good academic standing; students who take a leave
while on academic action will return on academic action.
When a leave begins when a term is already in session, the
student’s transcript will reflect the action of withdrawal and the
date of withdrawal for the semester in question. If the date of
withdrawal for a medical leave is on or before the Columbia
College withdrawal deadline (November 14 for Fall 2024 and
March 27 for Spring 2025), the student’s transcript will not
reflect the individual courses attempted during the term. If the
date of withdrawal for a leave begins after the Columbia College
withdrawal deadline, individual courses will remain on the
transcript.
Ordinarily, Columbia College students who are authorized to
withdraw for medical reasons after the withdrawal deadline will
receive a mark of W for each of their courses for the term. These
notations indicate an authorized withdrawal from the courses.
their advising deans and departments to create a reasonable
academic plan to ensure the timely completion of their degree.
Students are not permitted to earn transferable credits
toward the degree while on medical leave from the
University, as the purpose of the leave is to regain full health
in order to return and resume full-time study. In some cases,
healthcare practitioners may recommend that students take
courses at home institutions as part of the recovery process.
It is recommended that students follow the advice of their
healthcare practitioners; however, they should make their
decisions knowing that coursework taken elsewhere while on
medical leave may not be transferred back to Columbia to count
towards their degree.
If a student matriculates at another institution in a degree
program while on leave from Columbia, the student will be
considered to have transferred to another institution and will
be permanently withdrawn from Columbia College.
.
In rare cases, when a student must leave for medical reasons
beyond the relevant deadline, a student and advising dean in the
Berick Center for Student Advising can work together with the
faculty to determine whether an Incomplete would be a more
appropriate notation on the transcript.Readmission from Medical
Leave of Absence
• In order to be eligible for an Incomplete, the student must
have completed all work for the course except the final
paper, exam, or project. The student must also obtain the
approval of the relevant advising dean(s) in the Berick Center
for Student Advising as well as the appropriate faculty
member(s). Students should consult with their advising deans
in the Berick Center for Student Advising for more details.• Fall term readmission – June 1
• Spring term readmission – November 1
• Summer term readmission – not permitted
• Students who have been approved for authorized Incompletes
in the last semester before their medical leave must complete
the work of each course upon their return to campus by the
end of the Change of Program period of their first semester
after being readmitted. If the work is not completed by the
end of the Change of Program period of the term in which
the student returns, the grade may convert to the contingency
grade or to an F. Due dates for incomplete work should be
determined in consultation with the advising dean in the
Berick Center for Student Advising upon notification of
readmission.
When students begin a leave after the Columbia College
withdrawal deadline, they should be aware of the overall number
of credits that must be completed to remain in good academic
standing in future semesters. Students should keep in mind that
Columbia College students should complete an average of 15.5
points per term to remain in good academic standing. Students
should consult with their advising deans in the Berick Center
for Student Advising to learn whether or not they will fall below
the low points threshold (see section on Academic Standing)
established for Columbia College students and, if so, work with
Students must complete all parts of the following readmission
procedures by the following deadlines:
In order to begin the readmission process, students must first
discuss their plans with their advising deans in the Berick Center
for Student Advising and then submit the following letters to
their advising deans by email or fax:
1. Request for readmission: This letter should review the
circumstances that led to the leave, describe in detail any
activities pursued while away, explain why studies can now
be successfully resumed, and outline a plan for continued
support. The letter should also indicate whether or not
campus housing will be required.
2. Letter from medical practitioner supporting readmission:
This letter should describe the treatment prescribed for
the student and progress made by the student, provide an
evaluation of the student’s readiness to return to full-time
study at Columbia, and outline the recommended continued
care plan upon readmission.
The Medical Leave Readmission Committee is composed of
representatives of Columbia Health, the Berick Center for
Student Advising, and other key offices of the College and
the University. It meets in June and November to consider
readmission requests for the Fall and Spring terms, respectively.
Committee review is not guaranteed if documentation is
submitted after the stated deadlines. Students will receive
142Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
notification regarding one of the following three outcomes of the
committee’s assessment of readmission requests:
1. Applicants are approved for an interview by a Columbia
Health practitioner. Pending the results of the interview, a
student may be officially readmitted or denied readmission
and will be notified of a decision by the Berick Center for
Student Advising by letter and email. In some cases, the
medical professionals on the readmission committee may
decide an interview is not necessary before readmitting the
student.
2. Additional information is requested.
3. Readmission is denied. Students may reapply the following
semester for readmission. The decisions made by the Medical
Leave Readmission Committee are final and cannot be
appealed.
Once officially readmitted, students will be provided an online
registration appointment in order to enroll for the coming term.
Normally, students will be able to register in late August for
the Fall and in mid-January for the Spring term. In addition,
students who are guaranteed housing upon readmission may
submit a housing application by following the instructions in
their readmission letter. Students on leave cannot participate in
housing lotteries before being formally readmitted.
Students must address all financial or other obligations to the
University that may still be outstanding from the beginning
of their leave. If holds have been placed on their account,
these holds must be cleared before they can enroll in classes or
move into housing. If, after being readmitted for the following
semester, a student cannot register by the end of the Change of
Program period of that semester, then the student will be placed
on another leave of absence.
Students are urged to meet with their advising deans in the
Berick Center for Student Advising and, if they live in campus
housing, a Residential Life staff member, during the first two
weeks of their return to campus, to ensure a smooth transition
back to the campus community.
Voluntary Personal Leave of
Absence (nonmedical)
A voluntary leave of absence may be granted by the Committee
on Academic Standing to undergraduate students who request a
temporary withdrawal from Columbia College for a nonmedical
reason during the semester. Students do not need to petition the
Committee on Academic Standing if they request a voluntary
leave of absence prior to the start of the semester. Students
considering a voluntary leave must discuss this option in
advance with their advising deans in the Berick Center for
Student Advising.
Voluntary leaves are granted for a period of one to four
semesters. Students should be in good academic standing at the
time of the leave, and should be able to complete their degree in
a total of eight semesters.
When a leave begins after a term is in session, the student’s
transcript will reflect the action of withdrawal and the date of
withdrawal. If the date of withdrawal for a personal leave is on
or before the Columbia College withdrawal deadline (November
14 for Fall 2024 and March 27 for Spring 2025), the student’s
transcript will not reflect the individual courses attempted during
the term.
Normally, if a voluntary leave of absence begins after the
Columbia College withdrawal deadline, the student’s transcript
will include all courses attempted, with each course receiving
a mark of W (indicating authorized withdrawal). In certain
circumstances, a student may qualify for an Incomplete for a
course, and the remaining work for the course would have to
be completed by the end of the Change of Program period of
the semester in which the student returns to Columbia. If the
Incomplete is not completed by that time, the contingency grade
or a W will be inserted as the final grade.
Students may not take courses for transferable credit while on
leave. If a student matriculates at another institution in a degree
program while on leave from Columbia, the student will be
considered to have transferred to another institution and will be
permanently withdrawn from Columbia College. Students who
choose to take voluntary leaves are not guaranteed housing upon
return to the University. International students should contact the
International Students and Scholars Office to ensure that a leave
will not jeopardize their ability to return to Columbia College.
To return to Columbia College, students must notify the
Berick Center of Student Advising by June 1 for the Fall term
or November 1 for the Spring term. Students must request
readmission in writing and submit a statement describing their
readiness to return.
Family Emergency Leave of
Absence
Columbia College students who must leave the university for
urgent family reasons that necessitate a semester-long absence
(e.g., family death or serious illness in the family) may request
an emergency family leave of absence. Documentation of the
serious nature of the emergency must be provided. Students
must request an emergency family leave of absence from their
advising deans in the Berick Center for Student Advising.
When an emergency family leave begins after a term is in
session, the student’s transcript will reflect the action of
withdrawal and the date of withdrawal. If the date of withdrawal
for an emergency family leave of absence is on or before the
Columbia College withdrawal deadline (November 14 for Fall
2024 and March 27 for Spring 2025), the student’s transcript
will not reflect the individual courses attempted during the
term. Normally, if an emergency family leave begins after the
Columbia College withdrawal deadline, the student’s transcript
will include all courses attempted, with each course receiving
a mark of W (indicating authorized withdrawal). In certain
circumstances, a student may qualify for an Incomplete for a
143Academic Regulations
course, and the remaining work for the course would have to
be completed by the end of the Change of Program period of
the semester in which the student returns to Columbia. If the
Incomplete is not completed by that time, the contingency grade
or a W will be inserted as the final grade.
To return to Columbia College, students must notify the
Berick Center of Student Advising by June 1 for the Fall term
or November 1 for the Spring term. Students must request
readmission in writing and submit a statement describing their
readiness to return. Once readmission is granted, housing will be
guaranteed.
Failure to Graduate
Students who fail to graduate by their final semester have, in
effect, been withdrawn from the College and therefore must
apply for readmission within a two-year period in order
to have an opportunity to complete the degree. If they do
not complete their degree within two years, then they may be
permanently withdrawn.
To apply for readmission, students must have successfully
completed no fewer than 90 points of academic credit and
earned a GPA of no less than 2.0. Students must fulfill the
degree and major requirements in place at the point of original
matriculation.
Readmission will be predicated upon the assessment of the
student's ability to successfully complete the degree within
one calendar year. Inquiries regarding readmission should be
directed to the Berick Center for Student Advising.
Readmission
In general, students seeking readmission to Columbia College
must submit evidence that they have achieved the purposes for
which they left. Consequently, specific readmission procedures
are determined by the reasons for the withdrawal. Policy
statements outlining the readmission procedures for voluntary or
medical leaves of absences are available in the Berick Center for
Student Advising. Students should consult their advising deans
for further information.
Students applying for readmission should complete all parts of
the appropriate readmission procedures by June 1 for the Fall
term or November 1 for the Spring term. Once an international
student with F-1 or J-1 status is readmitted, the student should
contact the International Students and Scholars Office to obtain a
new visa certificate (form I-20 or form DS-2019).
The Committee on Instruction
The undergraduate curriculum for Columbia College, and
all attendant policies, are managed by the Committee on
Instruction, which is co-chaired by the Dean of Columbia
College and the Dean of the School of General Studies and
which has twelve faculty members representing the three
academic divisions (humanities, social sciences, and natural
sciences), as well as faculty representatives from Barnard
College, the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied
Science, and the School of the Arts.
This Bulletin reflects in its annual publication the curriculum
and policy recommendations approved by the Committee on
Instruction.
The Committee on Academic
Standing
The policy and regulations approved by the faculty Committee
on Instruction are implemented and administered for
Columbia College students by the Committee on Academic
Standing, composed of advising deans, an associate dean of
advising, and the dean of advising of the Berick Center for
Student Advising. The Committee on Academic Standing
is expected to uphold the recommendations and policies
established by the Committee on Instruction, the University
Senate, or the faculty as a whole.
Degree Requirements
Columbia College policy requires students to fulfill the general
degree requirements (i.e., all Core Curriculum coursework and
any general elective credit) that are stated in the Bulletin of the
first year of their matriculation at Columbia College, and to
fulfill the major requirements that are stated in the Bulletin at
the time that students declare their major (typically in the second
year of study).
Modification of Requirements
The requirements for the degree may be modified or waived in
individual and rare cases only with the approval of the dean of
Academic Affairs of Columbia College, acting on behalf of the
faculty Committee on Instruction of Columbia College. Students
wishing to petition for a modification of degree requirements
should discuss their requests with their advising deans in the
Berick Center for Student Advising.
Students may not take courses for transferable credit while
on leave. If a student matriculates at another institution in a
degree program while on leave from Columbia, the student
will be considered to have transferred to another institution
and will be permanently withdrawn from Columbia College.

Registration and Enrollment
Policies published by the
Office of the Registrar
"Registration" is the systematic process by which eligible
students reserve a seat for themselves in current or future
classes. Students use the Vergil/SSOL system to register for
courses at Columbia. Students receive informational emails from
the Registrar’s Office each semester that detail the procedures
for registration for the term.
"Enrollment" is the completion of the registration process,
and affords the full rights and privileges of student status.
Enrollment is accomplished by the payment or other satisfaction
of tuition and fees and by the satisfaction of other obligations to
the University.
Registration alone does not guarantee enrollment; nor does
registration alone guarantee the right to participate in a class.
In some cases, students need to obtain the approval of the
instructor or of a representative of the department offering
the course. Students may also be required to attend the first
few class sessions prior to official registration or to confirm
official registration. Please check the course information in the
Departments, Programs, and Courses section of this Bulletin and
the course information noted in the Directory of Classes for any
approvals required to register for a particular course.
To comply with current and anticipated Internal Revenue
Service mandates, the University requires all students who have
a Social Security Number (SSN) at the time of admission to
report it. The University recognizes that international students
are not eligible to apply for a SSN unless they are employed and
that not all students will be eligible to obtain a SSN during their
program of study. Newly admitted students who do not have
Social Security numbers should obtain one well in advance of
first registration. International students who will be employed
on-campus should follow the ISSO instructions for applying for
a SSN soon after their arrival in the United States. International
students should consult with the International Students and
Scholars Office for more information.
According to University regulations, each person who completes
registration is considered a student of the University during the
term for which they register, unless the student’s connection
with the University is officially severed by withdrawal or
otherwise. No student registered or enrolled in any school/
college of the University shall at the same time be registered or
enrolled in any other school/college, either of the University or
of any other institution, unless there is an existing registration
agreement between the two schools. Students who wish to
register or enroll in another institution must receive specific
authorization from the dean/director of the school/college in
which the student is first registered.
The privileges of the University are not available to any student
until they have completed registration. A student who is not
officially registered for a University course may not attend the
course, with the possible exception of a course in which students
are required to attend the first few class sessions prior to official
registration. No student may register after the stated period
unless he or she obtains the consent, written or electronic, of the
appropriate dean or director.
The University reserves the right to withhold the privilege
of registration or any other University privilege from any
person with an unpaid debt to the University. Students who
are permitted to enroll after the beginning of the term are
responsible for any absences incurred due to the late enrollment.
College Registration Policies
and Procedures
Registration instructions are emailed to all students by the Office
of the Registrar in advance of each registration period. Students
are expected to register for courses during the time periods
explicitly identified by the Office of the Registrar.
All Columbia College students must be registered for a
minimum of 12 points of credit in any given semester. Each
Columbia College student must be registered for at least 12
points of credit by the close of the Change of Program period
(i.e., the end of the second week of classes in the Fall or Spring
term).
Students who are registered for fewer than 12 points by this
time will be withdrawn from the College. An exception to this
rule can be a graduating senior who needs fewer than 12 points
of credit to complete the Bachelor of Arts degree from the
College; a student in this situation may petition the Committee
on Academic Standing for permission to register for fewer than
12 points of credit, with the understanding that they will be
viewed as full-time students who are responsible for paying full-
time tuition and for all other rules that apply to full-time students
in the College.
Some classes may be blocked for online registration and require
written approval; students should check Vergil or the Directory
of Classes for approval information. Courses blocked from
online registration require additional approval, either in SSOL
or through an academic adviser. A completed Registration
Adjustment Form, with all necessary approvals confirmed, may
be required. A student cannot use the Registration Adjustment
Form to register for a course if the course is not blocked from
online registration or if the student is eligible to join the course
Wait List. Students should speak with their academic advisers to
learn more information about this process.
A student’s ability to register for courses may be put on hold
by various offices within the University. Students can check for
Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025Registration
holds in their Vergil/SSOL accounts. Note: Only the office that
places the hold has the ability to remove it.
Students are responsible for ensuring that their academic
programs are in accordance with the College and University
policies noted here. The Committee on Academic Standing in
the Berick Center for Student Advising is tasked with upholding
the academic policies of the College and will make changes
to students’ registration if the students fail to ensure that their
academic programs comply with these policies set by the
faculty. Questions about registration should be directed to the
Berick Center for Student Advising.
Early Registration Periods
Current students first have the opportunity to register for classes
during the early registration period in the preceding semester:
early registration for Fall classes occurs during one week in the
previous April, and early registration for Spring classes occurs
during one week in the previous November.
After that early registration period, there are certain weeks
before the beginning of the term designated for registration
changes, during which students can continue to add and
drop classes for the upcoming semester. A complete list of
registration periods can be found on the Registrar's website.
Change-of-Program Period
The first two weeks of a Fall term or a Spring term are known as
the "change of program" period, when students can continue to
add and drop classes in order to finalize their academic programs
for the term.
The deadline for adding a course in a Fall or Spring semester
will always be the second Friday of the term (i.e., the end of the
second week of classes).
Student Registration
Appointment Times
During registration weeks, students are assigned registration
"appointment times" – i.e. windows of time on weekdays when
students can perform registration activities through Vergil/
SSOL.
Students’ individual registration times are listed in Vergil/
Student Services Online (SSOL) and registration dates are noted
on the Academic Calendar in this Bulletin. Students should also
consult the Registrar’s website for additional information.
During early registration, these appointment times are assigned
based on seniority, with the current seniors (in Fall) or rising
seniors (in Spring) given appointment times on Monday; the
current juniors (in Fall) or rising juniors (in Spring) added on
Tuesday; the current sophomores (in Fall) or rising sophomores
(in Spring) added on Wednesday; and current first-year students
(in Fall) added on Thursday. Within that structure, most students'
appointment times are randomly assigned.
SSOL Course Waitlists
Most courses have electronic waitlists attached to them in SSOL
– although there are some courses (for instance, courses in the
Core Curriculum) that will not have electronic waitlists. If a
course is full and has an attached electronic waitlist, students
may choose to add themselves to the waitlist within SSOL.
Waitlist activity will continue until the Thursday evening prior
to the last day of the Change of Program Period at 9:30pm EST.
Electronic waitlists may be automated or self-managed:
• If a course’s electronic waitlist is automated, when a space
opens on the course roster during a registration period, the
student at the top of the waitlist will automatically be added
to the course roster. The student will receive notification
that registration for the course has been successful, and the
update to the course roster and electronic waitlist will occur
overnight and be reflected on SSOL the following day.
• If a course’s electronic waitlist is self-managed, the instructor
or the relevant department/program will select the students
from the waitlist who can register for the course. The criteria
for selection will vary from course to course: there may
be priority for declared majors, graduating seniors, first-
year students, students who have submitted successful
applications, etc. If additional materials must be submitted
for consideration for selection, students will typically receive
an automated email with details when they add themselves to
the self-managed electronic waitlist.
Registration Limits and
Petition Processes
Students are allowed to register for a maximum of 18 points
of credit in any Fall or Spring term. If a student’s academic
program contains more than 18 credits after the student is
admitted into one or more class(es) from waitlists, the student
must adjust the academic program to bring their registration into
alignment with the 18-credit semester cap by dropping one or
more course(s) by the end of the Change of Program period.
If a student has a compelling reason to register for more than
18 credits in a term, the student can petition the Committee on
Points and Programs for permission to exceed the credit limit.
Students are not allowed to exceed the 18-credit limit in their
first semester as matriculated students, whether they are entering
first-year students or entering transfer students.
Students may not register for courses whose meeting times
overlap. If a student’s academic program contains classes whose
meeting times overlap after the student is admitted into one
or more class(es) from waitlists, the student must adjust the
academic program to bring their registration into alignment with
this regulation by dropping one of the overlapping courses by
the end of the Change of Program period.
146Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Dropping a Course
Students may drop a course from their academic program
through the deadline noted during the fifth week of classes. Until
this deadline, students can drop a course themselves online via
Student Services Online (SSOL), although they are encouraged
to talk with their advising dean about their choice to drop in
order to consider all of their options.
If a course is successfully dropped before this deadline, the
course will be removed from the student’s program and
transcript.
Note: The five shared Core Curriculum courses – Art
Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Frontiers of
Science, Literature Humanities, and have their own
particular drop deadline, which coincides with the end of
the Change of Program Period at the end of the first two
weeks of classes. See “Dropping or Withdrawing from Core
Curriculum Courses” below.
When considering the option to drop from a course, students
should be aware that, in order to remain in good academic
standing, they must successfully complete no fewer than 12
points in a given semester. Students who do not earn at least
12 points per term will be placed on academic probation, or be
suspended or dismissed. Students who do not make adequate
progress to the degree (an average of 15.5 points per term) will
also face academic probation, suspension, or dismissal.
Neither failure to attend classes nor a student’s personal
communication to an instructor of intent to drop will constitute
dropping from a course. Students who stop attending classes
without dropping or officially withdrawing are assigned the
letter grade earned by factoring a zero or F for any missing
work.
Withdrawing from a Course
After the drop deadline has passed, students may remove
themselves from a course by withdrawing from the course. The
deadline to withdraw from a course is the Monday of the last
full week of a Fall or Spring term. If a student successfully
withdraws from a course after the drop deadline and before the
withdrawal deadline, the course will remain on the student’s
program and transcript with a notation of “W”, with no credit or
final grade earned.
To withdraw from a class, students must first meet with their
advising dean in the Berick Center for Student Advising to
discuss their choice to withdraw in order to consider all of
their options. Students must then submit a Columbia College
Acknowledgment of Course Withdrawal form to their advising
dean in the Berick Center for Student Advising.
After the course withdrawal deadline, students may not
withdraw from any course and will receive the letter grade
earned in the course. In cases that have been referred for
disciplinary action through the Dean’s Discipline process, a
student may not drop or withdraw from the course in question
without a successful petition to the Committee on Academic
Standing.
When considering the option to withdraw from a course,
students should be aware that, in order to remain in good
academic standing, they must successfully complete no fewer
than 12 points in a given semester. Students who do not earn at
least 12 points per term will be placed on academic probation, or
be suspended or dismissed. Students who do not make adequate
progress to the degree (an average of 15.5 points per term) will
also face academic probation, suspension, or dismissal.
Neither failure to attend classes nor a student’s personal
communication to an instructor of intent to withdraw will
constitute dropping or withdrawing from a course. Students
who stop attending classes without dropping or officially
withdrawing are assigned the letter grade earned by factoring a
zero or F for any missing work.
Dropping or Withdrawing
from Core Curriculum Courses
The shared courses in the Core Curriculum – i.e., Art
Humanities, Contemporary Civilization, Frontiers of Science,
Literature Humanities, Music Humanities, and University
Writing – have their own drop deadline that is separate from
the standard drop deadline for other courses. The deadline to
drop one of the shared Core Curriculum courses is the end of the
Change of Program period-i.e., the end of the first two weeks of
classes.
After the Change of Program Period, students cannot drop or
withdraw from a Core Curriculum course. Students who have
compelling mitigating circumstances for withdrawing from
a Core Curriculum course must petition the Committee on
Academic Standing for permission to do so. It is possible that
students who receive a W in a Core Curriculum course may be
placed on academic probation.
All first-year students are required to complete Frontiers of
Science, Literature Humanities (both semesters), and University
Writing successfully by the end of the first year. Students who
do not complete one or more of these three courses will be
placed on academic probation; therefore, students considering
dropping or withdrawing from a Core Curriculum course should
consult their advising deans before taking any action. For more
details, see the section on Core Curriculum in this Bulletin.
Declaring the Pass/D/Fail
Option using the Registration
System
The Pass/D/Fail option is available only for certain courses
in a students’ program. Students should refer to Academic
Regulations—Exams and Grades listed in this Bulletin for more
information regarding this grading option.
The deadline for declaring the Pass/D/Fail option for a course
is the final day of classes in a Fall or Spring term. Up until this
147Registration
deadline, students may elect to change their course grading
options for eligible courses from letter grading to Pass/D/Fail or
from Pass/D/Fail to letter grading online via Student Services
Online (SSOL). The Pass/D/Fail option can be applied only
under certain conditions, which are detailed in the section on
“Grades” in the Academics Regulations section of this Bulletin.
148STUDY ABROAD
The Center for Global
Engagement
The Columbia University Center for Undergraduate Global
Engagement (UGE) develops and supports academic and co-
curricular opportunities for global learning and engagement for
all undergraduates. These opportunities include study abroad,

uge@columbia.edu
Studying in a foreign country for a semester, a full year, or a
summer, represents a significant enhancement to the Columbia
College education. Study abroad expands the boundaries of
the institution and offers students the opportunity to gain first-
hand experience of the larger global community of which
we are all members. Students engaged in international study
discover insights into other cultures, develop new perspectives,
and learn to reflect on how their own culture has shaped their
understanding of the world. Students interested in studying
abroad should visit the Center for Undergraduate Global
Engagement as early as possible to discuss their academic goals
and to develop a plan for integrating international study into
their curriculum.
Eligibility
• Students must have at least junior standing for study abroad
in a Fall and/or Spring semester. Students in any class year
can study abroad during the summer.
• Students must have made satisfactory progress toward
completion of the Core Curriculum; specifically, students
must have completed Contemporary Civilization (both
semesters), Frontiers of Science, Literature Humanities (both
semesters), and University Writing.
• Students must be in good academic and disciplinary standing.
A review of each student's academic and disciplinary records
is conducted as part of the required clearance process.
Students on academic or disciplinary probation are not
permitted to study abroad during the term of their probation.
It is generally possible to arrange for study in most foreign
countries through programs sponsored by Columbia or by other
institutions, or through direct application to foreign universities.
Such studies may be approved for one to two terms in the junior
year or during any summer term.
Credit and Grading
Columbia-Sponsored Programs
Students who enroll in the following Columbia-sponsored
programs receive direct Columbia credit for their courses. The
grades earned in their studies are reflected on their official
transcripts and cumulative GPA.
Columbia-sponsored programs include the following:
• Berlin Consortium for German Studies
• Consortium for Advanced Studies in Cuba
• Kyoto Center for Japanese Studies
Non-Columbia Study Abroad Programs
Credit earned through approved programs run by other
institutions is applied toward the degree as transfer credit when
the student returns to the College, upon receipt of appropriate
transcripts and other supporting materials. Grades earned in
courses through approved programs run by other institutions are
not reflected on the transcript or in the cumulative GPA.
College transfer students should note that they are permitted
no more than 60 points of outside credit, and that approved
programs run by other institutions would be considered outside
credit (see Academic Regulations—Regulations for Transfer
Students).
The College maintains the authority over students' participation
in study abroad programs and upholds standards for all potential
candidates. To be eligible for participation in a Columbia-
approved study abroad program, students must meet the
following criteria:All students are reminded that the final 30 credits required for
the degree must be taken while enrolled in the College for study
on Columbia's New York campus or on one of the Columbia-
sponsored programs abroad. Any exceptions require special
permission from the Committee on Academic Standing.
• Students must have a minimum cumulative GPA of
3.0, inclusive of the semester before going abroad.In addition, the following conditions apply for credit for courses
taken during study abroad:
1. Courses taught abroad in subjects that are typically taught
at Columbia in the professional schools – e.g., business,
Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025Study Abroad
education, journalism – may not be eligible for credit.
Students should confirm ahead of time whether such courses
could receive credit toward the Bachelor of Arts degree
offered by Columbia College.
2. Transfer credit is not awarded for courses taken on a
Pass/Fail basis in outside programs. The minimum grade
necessary for transfer of credit is C-.
Study Abroad Clearance
Students must be cleared to study on approved programs by
the Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement by October 1
for the Spring semester and by March 1 for the Fall semester or
full academic year. Students must register with this office before
November 15 for the Spring semester and April 15 for the Fall
semester or the full academic year.

France: Columbia in Paris
Established in 1966, the Columbia Program in Paris at Reid
Hall offers semester, academic-year, and summer study-abroad
options that challenge students to step outside the boundaries
of a traditional French language program and use French as
a means to further their understanding of their own area of
study. Students with a good command of the French language
refine their speaking and writing skills through intensive
language training and by taking selected disciplinary courses
taught in French specifically for the program at Reid Hall
and in the French university system at partner institutions:
Institut d'Etudes Politiques (Sciences Po), University of Paris I
(Panthéon Sorbonne), and the University of Paris IV (Sorbonne).
Opportunities for participating in directed research are also
available. An English-based curriculum is available in the fall

Program
The Columbia in London Program is a collaboration with
Columbia's Department of English and Comparative Literature,
in partnership with Queen Mary University of London (QMUL),
one of the UK's most prestigious academic institutions.
Each fall, the program is led by a Columbia faculty member
whose research directly engages the literary culture of London.
That faculty member will offer a version of the Global Seminar
that will enable participating students to study literary texts in
their immediate geographical and cultural settings, transforming
their relationship to their objects of study and encouraging
them to develop a wider range of reading practices and research
methodologies. In addition to regular class meetings, the Global
Seminar will involve regular outings, designed to complement
and enhance the readings and classroom discussions.
In addition to the Global Seminar, students will also enroll
alongside local students in courses offered by the host
institution. QMUL offers programs across a broad range of
disciplines, including physical and natural sciences, business and
management, engineering, humanities, and social sciences.

Summer Study Abroad Approval
Students seeking to study abroad during the summer must be
approved by the Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement.
If students take foreign language courses abroad in non-
Columbia programs, credit for those courses will be awarded
only under the following conditions:
• Credits for language study at the elementary and intermediate
levels are awarded after the student takes a placement exam
with the relevant Columbia department or program and
shows sufficient proficiency in the language. Credits for
more advanced levels of language study are accepted for
academic credit upon review by the appropriate language
department.
• The only other courses in non-Columbia summer programs
abroad that can be taken for credit are courses that have been
approved by a Columbia department or program to fulfill a
requirement for a major or concentration. These courses must
be taken abroad in a foreign language.
• Limited exceptions can be made for awarding credit for
summer courses taught in English. College credit may be
granted if the course offers a unique experience, such as
specialized field-work or research, where the study-abroad
site functions as a constituent part of the course. In such
cases, the program must be approved by the Center for
Undergraduate Global Engagement. Departmental approval
is required and the course must satisfy major or concentration
requirements.

United Kingdom: Columbia Summer Research
Practicum in Global Behavioral Science
(GLOBES)
This three-week program provides students an immersive
learning experience focused on reproducible behavioral research
across languages and settings. Students will travel to Cambridge
and work with international researchers on a new research
question each summer. The objective is for students to get
hands-on experience in carrying out behavioral science research,
from study development to dissemination, while participating in
a large, international collaboration, resulting in a publication co-
authored by the students.
Credit and Grading
As with other types of study abroad programs, all academic
work completed abroad counts toward the Columbia degree, and
students may take classes toward the major with the department's
approval.
Tuition and Finances
Columbia College students who attend these exchange programs
have the same access to financial aid they would have if they
were enrolled in classes on Columbia's New York campus.
Columbia students pay their usual Columbia tuition and are
responsible for non-academic costs abroad.
Students may direct financial aid and study abroad
inquiries to the Financial Aid and Educational Financing;
212-854-3711; ugrad-finaid@columbia.edu.
For program information, students may consult
global.undergrad.columbia.edu and email uge@columbia.edu.
Global Columbia Collaboratory:
Environmental Humanities and Global
Health / Sustainable Development
The Education for Sustainable Development programs of the
Global Columbia Collaboratory offer the opportunity to virtually
engage with a small group of Columbia University students, as
well as faculty, students, and community organizations abroad
over fifteen weeks in the summer. The program includes an in-
country portion in various locations for durations from one to
three weeks. For program information, students may consult
global.undergrad.columbia.edu/studyabroad/search/columbia-
programs and email uge@columbia.edu.
Exchange Programs
In order to provide the richest and most immersive experience
possible to its students, Columbia has established a network of
exchange agreements with international institutions. With an
exchange agreement, Columbia students may study at a partner
institution; in exchange, students from the foreign institution
may study at Columbia. At the partner institutions, students
enroll in regular courses alongside local students, live in campus
housing, have an academic adviser, and have access to all
university facilities and resources.
Currently, Columbia has undergraduate exchanges with the
following institutions:
• Bocconi University
• Bo#aziçi University
• Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
• University of Hong Kong
Students who plan to apply to these programs should consult
with the Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement.

Preprofessional Advising
Berick Center for Student Advising
preprofessional@columbia.edu
Medical, dental, and other health professional schools prefer
that undergraduates complete a four-year program of study
culminating in a bachelor’s degree. All health professional
schools require prerequisite coursework, but the specific
coursework can vary somewhat from program to program and
school to school. This coursework can be completed during the
undergraduate years along with the Core Curriculum and the
major.
Majors for Students Preparing
for Health Professional
School
There is no major preferred by medical school admissions
committees. Students are encouraged to pursue a major in
any field that appeals to them. Students majoring in a non-
science area may wish to pursue additional coursework in
a science area, or perhaps a minor in a science field, that
overlaps with the coursework for their premedical requirements
in order to demonstrate their interest and aptitude in the
sciences. Students should work closely with their advising
deans and preprofessional advisers from the Berick Center for
Student Advising, as well as their departmental major adviser in
planning a program that meets their interests.
Premedical Requirements
It is very important to note that each medical school in the
United States and Canada individually determines its own
entrance requirements, including prerequisite coursework
or expected competencies. Each medical school also sets its
own rules regarding acceptable courses or course equivalents.
It is therefore essential that students confirm the premedical
requirements for each medical school to which they intend to
apply.
In addition to medical school course requirements, medical
schools currently require applicants to sit for the Medical
College Admissions Test (MCAT). Students preparing for
medical school are advised to take the following courses, as they
will meet the prerequisites for most medical schools and will
prepare applicants for the MCAT:
• 1 year of General Chemistry and General Chemistry Lab;
• 1 year of Organic Chemistry and Organic Chemistry Labs;
• 1 year of Introductory Biology and Biology Lab;
• 1 year of General Physics and Physics Labs;
• 1 semester Biochemistry;
• 1 semester of Introductory Psychology
At Columbia, the following courses correspond to the above

While these courses are recommended for MCAT preparation,
students should note the following additional information:
• English: Most medical schools require one year of English,
emphasizing skill acquisition in writing. Columbia College
students fulfill this requirement with UNIVERSITY
WRITING (ENGL CC1010) and Masterpieces of Western
Literature and Philosophy (Literature Humanities)
(HUMA CC1001-HUMA CC1002).
• Mathematics: Although not required by most medical
schools, calculus is required for Columbia chemistry
sequences and therefore all premedical students should
have successfully completed the equivalent of one semester
of Calculus. Medical schools that do have a mathematics
requirement typically expect one semester of calculus
and one semester of statistics. Any Columbia calculus
and statistics classes will meet the requirement and it is
sometimes possible to use AP credit toward this requirement.
• Biochemistry: An increasing number of medical schools
require one semester of biochemistry. While Columbia's
introductory biology sequence covers many foundational
concepts of biochemistry, which may prepare students for
the MCAT, many medical schools will require a course in
Biochemistry prior to matriculation.
• Advanced Biology: A small number of schools require more
than one year of introductory biology and many of these
recommend specific advanced level classes.
• Social and Behavioral Science: A number of schools have
begun to add social and behavioral science courses into their
requirements, including, but not limited to, psychology and
sociology.
Students should note that medical schools’ stated prerequisites
are subject to change from year to year and it is the
responsibility of students to confirm the prerequisite
requirements for each of the medical schools to which they
intend to apply. Most medical schools list their requirements
in greater detail on their individual websites. More information
can also be found from the Association of American Medical
Colleges (AAMC).
Students interested in preparing for other health professions,
including dental school, should consult a pre-health advisor
in the Berick Center for Student Advising about curricular
planning.
Barnard Courses
While it is preferred that students complete their premedical
requirements with Columbia College courses, students may take
premedical requirements at Barnard if course prerequisites have
been satisfied in advance. However, students should keep in
mind that the Columbia Biology and Chemistry Departments
may not accept Barnard courses toward their departments'
concentrations and majors. Students should consult their
departmental advisers before registering for a Barnard course.
Students with Advanced
Placement
Advanced Placement (AP) credit is accepted by some health
professional schools, but not all. Students are responsible for
monitoring the requirements of each school to which they intend
to apply.
Generally, students with AP credit are strongly advised to take
further courses in the field in which they have received such
credit.
155Special Programs
Application to Health
Profession Programs
For many health professions programs, students apply for
admission more than a year in advance of matriculation. Most
Columbia students take time between undergraduate and health
profession school and thus wait to apply to these schools until
after graduating. Students who are interested in going directly
on to health professional school following graduation should
complete all prerequisite courses which will prepare them for
application by the end of the junior year.
Students planning to apply to medical or dental school
should meet with preprofessional advisers prior to
application and plan to go through the Premedical Advisory
Committee process the year they plan to apply. For more
information regarding this process, please consult with
a preprofessional adviser in the Berick Center for Student
Advising (preprofessional@columbia.edu).
Clinical and Research
Exposure
Preprofessional Advising maintains an online list of many
different clinical volunteer and research opportunities across
New York City and beyond. These opportunities can offer
students the chance to explore the health professions and to
interact with patients, and these experiences are viewed by
medical schools as essential preparation. Students are therefore
strongly encouraged to spend time volunteering or working in
clinical and research environments before applying to medical
school.

156Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Students with more than 35 transfer credits are not eligible for
the 3-2 program.The Graduate School of Arts &
Sciences
If accepted into the 3-2 program, students will be enrolled at
the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science
in the fourth and fifth years of study. During those years, the
students must complete the requirements for a major in the
Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science
in consultation with a faculty advisor for their engineering
department. Students eligibility for housing and financial aid
will continue throughout these years of study.The B.A./M.A. option allows Columbia College students to
enroll in graduate-level courses at Columbia and apply the
earned credit toward a Columbia Master of Arts (M.A.).
Each Fall, Undergraduate Admissions conducts information
sessions in which students meet with the Combined Plan
Program administrator. For more information, students should
contact their advising deans in the Berick Center for Student
Advising, or combinedplan@columbia.edu.
The 4+1 Program with Columbia College
The 4+1 Program provides students in The Fu Foundation
School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) the
opportunity to obtain a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia
College, in addition to their Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree
from SEAS, through the completion of one additional year of
study. Students in the 4+1 program must complete four years of
study and complete all requirements for the Bachelor of Science
degree in engineering before enrolling in the fifth year of study
in Columbia College.
The fifth year of study commences in the Fall semester, and
students are required to conclude their studies after two full-time
semesters of enrollment. Students must earn a minimum of 31
credits while enrolled at Columbia College
SEAS students who are interested in the 4+1 Program must
declare their interest in the spring of their sophomore year and
plan their next three years of study with the program adviser.
The program is selective, and admission is based on the
following factors:
1. Granting of the B.S. at SEAS at the end of the fourth year
2. Completing all Columbia College Core
Curriculum requirements by the end of the fourth year at
SEAS
3. Maintaining a minimum GPA of 3.0 in Columbia College
Core courses as well as those courses counting toward the
Columbia College major
4. Creating a plan to complete a Columbia College major or
concentration by the end of their fifth year that is approved
by the appropriate director of undergraduate studies.
For more information, students may contact their advising dean
in the Berick Center for Student Advising.
Only students who have been accepted by the Graduate School
of Arts & Sciences into a B.A./M.A. program will be allowed to
count graduate-level courses taken as an undergraduate toward
the requirements for the M.A. Coursework taken toward the
B.A./M.A. option is subject to the following guidelines:
1. The credit for the coursework must be in excess of the 124
points required for the B.A. degree.
2. A course used to fulfill a requirement for the B.A. degree
may not be counted toward graduate credit.
3. The student must obtain the approval of both the graduate
department(s) offering the course(s) and the undergraduate
department in which they are majoring.
4. The maximum amount of graduate credit that an
undergraduate can earn toward the M.A. degree requirement
in the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences is 0.50 Residence
Unit. For more information on the Residence Units for
graduate programs, please consult the relevant website of the
Graduate School of Arts & Sciences.
Students who are interested in pursuing the B.A./M.A. option
must consult the director of graduate studies (DGS) or program
director of their intended M.A. program before applying:
this consultation is a required part of the application process
and must take place before a B.A./M.A. application may be
submitted. Students should then plan to apply officially at
least two months prior to the semester in which they intend to
begin taking courses that will count toward the M.A., and it
is important to note that some academic programs have more
specific application deadlines.
The Juilliard School
Columbia College students who are exceptionally talented
musicians have access to instrumental, composition, and
voice instruction at The Juilliard School through two distinct
programs.
The Cross-Registration Program
The Cross-Registration Program allows Columbia College
students to enroll concurrently in weekly instrumental (classical
and jazz), composition, and vocal instruction at The Juilliard
School. The Cross-Registration Program covers weekly
instruction only; ensembles and classes at Juilliard are generally
not open to participants in the Cross-Registration Program.
Applicants to the Cross-Registration Program may be incoming
first-year students or continuing students in Columbia College.
In addition to being accepted by Columbia College, Students
157Special Programs
interested in the Cross-Registration Program must submit a
Juilliard Application for Admission, including pre-screening
materials, and must audition successfully to be accepted into the
Cross-Registration Program.The Law School
Accelerated Interdisciplinary Legal Education
Program
Students in the Cross-Registration Program may participate in
the program for up to four years of study. Annual juries will be
held at Juilliard at the end of each academic year to determine
that students are eligible to continue in the program.The Accelerated Interdisciplinary Legal Education (AILE)
Program provides Columbia College students with outstanding
records the opportunity to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree from
Columbia College and a Juris Doctor degree from Columbia
Law School in six years.
Students participating in the Cross-Registration Program have
the option of applying to the Joint B.A./M.M. Program in their
junior year (see details below).
The Joint B.A./M.M. Program
The Joint B.A./M.M. Program allows students to earn a
Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia College and a Master
of Music degree from The Juilliard School in five years. While
instrumentalists and composers are expected to complete the
dual degree program in five years, voice students may need
six years of study to complete the program, depending on
preparation.
Students interested in the Joint B.A./M.M. Program must have
participated in the Cross-Registration Program for at least one
year to be eligible to apply. Interested students must apply to
the joint degree program in their junior year at the College.
To be considered for the program, Columbia College students
must have completed by the end of junior year 94 points of
coursework, including all Core Curriculum requirements and all
requirements for a major. There are no prerequisite courses for
the courses in the M.M. program at Juilliard that are required
to qualify for admission to the Joint B.A./M.M. Program, but
students considering the program are encouraged to complement
their cross-registration instruction at Juilliard with music classes
and participation in ensembles at Columbia.
If accepted to Joint B.A./M.M. Program, students will become
full-time graduate students at Juilliard in their fourth year and
will be subject to Juilliard’s financial aid policies. While it may
be possible to complete 1-2 courses required for the B.A. degree
at Columbia College in the fourth year, students must receive
permission to do so from the College and will not be eligible for
financial aid from Columbia College in that fourth year.
Eligible students should submit the Juilliard Application for
Admission by the appropriate deadline. The pre-screening (if
applicable) is waived, and live auditions are held at The Juilliard
School in early March.
Students who wish to pursue the joint program should consult
with Alex España, Associate Dean, in the Berick Center for
Student Advising.
To be eligible to apply, students must have enrolled in all six
semesters of study for the B.A. from Columbia College on
Columbia’s New York campus. Students with semesters of
transfer credit or study abroad credit, even from Columbia
programs, are not eligible to apply to the joint program.
Applicants to the program must have completed by the end of
junior year 93 points of credit toward the B.A., including all
Columbia College Core Curriculum requirements and also the
requirements for a major. After formal admission to the Law
School, students are withdrawn from the College to become full-
time Law School students in their fourth year, and are subject to
the financial aid and housing policies of the Law School from
that point forward. In the fifth and sixth years of study (i.e.,
the second and third years at the Law School), students must
complete 12 points of coursework through the Graduate School
of Arts and Sciences, and the coursework must have the prior
approval of the student’s pre professional adviser.
Interested students should submit an application in the spring of
their junior year to the Preprofessional Advising in the Berick
Center for Student Advising. Columbia College may nominate
one or two juniors each year for consideration, and the final
admission determination is made by the Law School Admissions
Committee. Prospective participants in this program must take
the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) or Graduate Record
Examination (GRE) no later than the February administration of
either exam in the year of intended enrollment.
AILE students receive Columbia College and Law School
degrees at the same time, at the end of six years. AILE students
must apply for the B.A. degree the term before they expect to
graduate with the J.D. degree. Students should inform their
advising deans in the Berick Center for Student Advising of their
plans to graduate in in the sixth year in order to be considered
that year for honors and Phi Beta Kappa from the College.
For more information, students may contact Preprofessional
Advising, preprofessional@columbia.edu.

160ACADEMIC
HONORS, PRIZES,
AND FELLOWSHIPS
Valedictorian and
Salutatorian
Dean’s ListThe Committee on Honors, Awards, and Prizes reviews the
academic records of the most exceptional students nominated by
the faculty for Valedictorian and Salutatorian. Selection is based
not on GPA alone, but on the breadth, depth, rigor of academic
program, high quality of academic achievement, departmental
recommendations, and outstanding academic work beyond that
which is required for the degree.
During each academic term, students who have earned a
minimum GPA of 3.6 or better in 12 or more points of letter
credit in the preceding term are placed on the Dean’s List.The Committee on Honors, Awards, and Prizes considers both
academic standing and disciplinary standing within the College
when awarding Valedictorian and Salutatorian.
The grade P is considered neutral when the averages are figured,
and the dividing factor is reduced by the number of points taken
for Pass credit. Students who have received grades of D, F,
W (or UW pre-Spring 2014) during the term are not eligible
for consideration. In any given semester, the mark of YC
(year course) precludes the attainment of Dean's List status
until the grade for the entire year's coursework is awarded.
Students who receive the grade of IN (incomplete), approved in
advance by the Committee on Academic Standing, are eligible
for Dean’s List only after all IN grades are changed to letter
grades. Students who have been found responsible by the Office
of Student Conduct and Community Standards for a violation of
academic integrity will not be eligible for the Dean’s List during
the term of the sanction.Departmental Honors
College (Latin) HonorsDepartmental honors are awarded to no more than 10%, or,
in small departments, one member, of the graduating majors
(including all October, February, and May degrees);
The Bachelor of Arts degree will be awarded with honors in
three categories (cum laude, magna cum laude, summa cum
laude) to the top 25 percent of the graduating class. Honors are
determined by an undergraduate student's cumulative GPA for
all work at Columbia, with the top 5 percent of the graduating
class being awarded summa cum laude, the next 10 percent
being awarded magna cum laude, and the remaining 10 percent
awarded cum laude.
College honors are the highest academic recognition awarded
by the College. There is no separate consideration of honors for
October or February graduates. The honor is officially noted
on the diploma and transcript of students who have graduated.
October and February graduates may ask the Registrar to add an
honors notation to an already issued diploma.
Both academic standing and disciplinary standing are taken into
consideration when awarding College honors.
Latin Honors are calculated based on student academic
achievement in all semesters at Columbia, including the final
semester. Since final grades for seniors for spring semester
classes can be submitted only a few days before graduation, and
those grades must be part of a student's transcript to be eligible,
Latin Honors are typically announced following graduation.
Departmental honors may be established and awarded by any
Columbia College department or academic program, and is
recorded on a student’s final transcript. Students should consult
with their director of undergraduate studies no later than the
beginning of the first term of their senior year if they wish to be
considered for departmental honors. Students who are awarded
departmental honors are notified by their department in mid-
May. Not all departments and programs offer departmental
honors.
College guidelines for departmental honors include the
following four criteria:
A grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.6 in major courses is
expected for a student to be considered for departmental honors;
An honors thesis or equivalent project of high quality should be
required by each department or academic program in order to
receive departmental honors;
Academic departments and programs consider both academic
standing and disciplinary standing within the College when
awarding departmental honors. Please note that special
concentrations are not eligible for consideration for departmental
honors.
Phi Beta Kappa
This academic society was founded in 1776 to recognize and
celebrate friendship, morality, and learning. The Columbia
College Delta chapter was formed in 1869. Each year, 10% of
the senior class are inducted into Phi Beta Kappa by faculty who
are members of the society. Two percent are elected in the fall
and the other eight percent are elected in the spring. Selection is
based not only on academic achievement, but also on evidence
of intellectual promise, character, and achievement outside the
classroom. Academic achievement is measured by the strength
and rigor of the chosen academic program, as well as by grades
Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025Academic Honors, Prizes, and Fellowships
and faculty recommendations. Students may not apply for Phi
Beta Kappa nor may they solicit faculty for recommendations.
As with graduation honors, October and February graduates
are considered along with May graduates. Election to Phi Beta
Kappa is noted on a student’s transcript.
The faculty Phi Beta Kappa selection committee considers both
academic standing and disciplinary standing within the College
when electing new members to the society.
While prizes are typically awarded annually, they are done so at
the discretion of respective selection committees. Hence, should
a selection committee decide, in a particular year, that there are
no suitable candidates, the prize will not be awarded. Unless
otherwise noted, these prizes are awarded to Columbia College
students only.

process through which Columbia College responds to allegations
of student academic or behavioral misconduct. The primary aim
of the Dean's Discipline process is to educate students about the
impact their behavior may have on their own lives as well as
on the greater community, and therefore it is not designed as an
adversarial or legal process.
office’s website provides detailed information for students on
the policies around academic integrity, including the student
Honor Code that governs all academic work, the various
forms of academic dishonesty that students should avoid, and
resources for students to utilize in their own work. Students
with questions are encouraged to contact the office at ugrad-
integrity@columbia.edu.
Violating the standards of academic integrity severely inhibits
a student’s opportunity to mature academically, professionally,
and socially. Consequently, a violation of academic integrity
is one of the most serious offenses a student can commit at the
University.
Violations of academic integrity may be intentional or
unintentional and can include, but are not limited, to:
The Dean’s Discipline process is initiated when the College or
University receives a report that a student has allegedly violated
Columbia College or University policies or local, State, or
Federal laws. Students may be subject to Dean’s Discipline for
any activity that occurs on or off campus that impinges on the
rights of other students and community members.

A Columbia College education has two complementary
elements: the intellectual development of bodies of knowledge
and habits of mind, and the overall development of moral
character and personal ethics. These elements are supported by a
commitment to academic integrity.• Self-Plagiarism
Academic integrity defines an intellectual community and its
educational mission. As members of the intellectual community
of Columbia College, students are expected to respect and
acknowledge the intellectual work of others and denote clearly
how their own work relates to that of others.Violations of the policies regarding the above categories will be
subject to Dean’s Discipline.
Columbia College provides support for students as they
learn and practice the tenets of academic integrity in their
undergraduate studies through the office of Academic Integrity,
a part of the office of Students and Family Support. The
office of Academic Integrity provides training on academic
integrity for all incoming students to the College through
mandatory online programs for new students and through

Environment
The Columbia undergraduate classroom, whether real or
virtual, is a vital and dynamic space for learning, sustained
by the expectation that the class experience is shared only by
participants in the course. The free and respectful exchange of
ideas is the foundation of teaching and learning and can occur
only if all course participants agree as a matter of academic

integrity (subject to standard penalties) to respect the guidelines
established below.
To support and sustain the class experience, the Columbia
undergraduate Committee on Instruction sets forth the following
expectations, pertaining both to course materials and to course
meetings:
• Course materials, including handouts, readings, slides, and
attendant materials must not be broadly shared, distributed,
or sold outside the course environment (including on social
media) without permission of the instructor. They must be
understood as the product of instructors’ intellectual work,
and treated as their property.
• The contents of class discussion and breakout rooms may not
be circulated outside the classroom, in whole or in part, for
non-educational purposes (e.g., on social media) or outside
the Columbia community. Students are expected to respect
the complex dynamics of class discussion and use discretion
when repeating the ideas of others outside of the classroom.
The audio and visual recordings of class discussion and
breakout rooms belong to the course participants and
must be understood in the context of the course. This is
especially crucial to protect the identity of speakers; in
certain circumstances, failure to do so could be a form of
bullying and could endanger course participants.
• Recordings of class sessions must not be shared, in whole
or in part, with those outside the class. Students are not
permitted to record any portion of class sessions without the
explicit consent of the instructor.
Violations of the policies regarding the above categories will be
subject to Dean’s Discipline.
• Endangerment
• Endangerment to Animals
• Failure to Comply
• Falsification
• Violation of Fire Safety Policies
• Harassment
• Hazing
• Violation of Illegal Drugs Policy

• Violation of University Smoking Policy
• Unauthorized Surveillance/Photography
• Theft
• Violation of University Policies
• Vandalism/Damage to Property
• Weapons
Violations of the policies regarding the above categories will be
subject to Dean’s Discipline.
Behavioral Standards
University policy regarding behavior standards have been
developed for the purposes of maintaining a safe and healthy
educational environment. Categories of prohibited conduct
include, but are not limited to, the following:
• Unauthorized Access/Egress
• Prohibited use of Alcohol
• Collusion
• Prohibited use of Columbia University Identification Card
• Violation of Columbia University Non-Discrimination

Student Grievance Policies at
Columbia University
Columbia University is committed to fostering intellectual
inquiry in a climate of academic freedom and integrity. Its
members, students, and faculty alike, are expected to uphold
these principles and exhibit tolerance and respect for others. The
following procedures are part of a process to ensure that student
concerns about experiences in the classroom or with faculty are
addressed in an informed and appropriate manner.
Please note that the policies and processes listed here are
meant to address any potential concerns about a faculty
member's professional conduct and behavior toward students
in the classroom or in other instructional settings. Potential
concerns about grades awarded by a faculty member are
covered by separate policies and procedures, which can be
found on the College's website under "Academics".
Columbia believes that both students and faculty have the
right to express their views freely, within an atmosphere of
tolerance and civility. Faculty may present students with ideas
and interpretations that surprise, and even offend them. But
they must do so in an environment that is open to divergent
views. Faculty, of course, must not discriminate on the basis
Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025Columbia University Policies
of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or other
inappropriate categories.
The University offers several avenues of assistance to students
who feel that their professors have not lived up to these
responsibilities. These range from informal counseling and
mediation to formal grievance processes. It is a violation of
University policy to retaliate against any student who brings a
grievance procedure in good faith.
The Ombuds Office
When students encounter problems that they feel they cannot
discuss with their professors, they may, instead, turn to the
University Ombuds Office (http://ombuds.columbia.edu) for
information, clarification of University policies, and confidential
advice. The Ombuds Officer may refer students to other offices
for further assistance or engage in informal mediation at the
request of students. The Ombuds Officer does not have the
authority to conduct formal investigations.
Deans and Department Chairs
Students may also approach the chair of the department in which
their course is given for advice and assistance in resolving
problems with individual faculty. If they are not satisfied with
the assistance they receive or consider the chair to be part of the
problem, they may seek assistance from the dean of the School
within which they are enrolled or the dean or vice president
overseeing the School within which the course is offered. The
deans and vice presidents are authorized to conduct formal
investigation of student complaints against their professors and,
when they consider it appropriate, provide relief to the student
or impose sanctions against the professor in a manner that is
consistent with the University’s disciplinary policies for faculty.
The form such investigations take is left to the discretion of the
deans and vice presidents.
Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative
Action
When students believe that they have been the victims of
discrimination or sexual harassment by faculty, they may seek
assistance from the Office of the Associate Provost for Equal
Opportunity and Affirmative Action (http://eoaa.columbia.edu).
As described in the University’s Policy Statement on
Discrimination and Sexual Harassment, the Associate Provost
for Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action is empowered
to conduct investigations of their complaints, with certain
exceptions, as well as provide confidential advice and engage in
informal mediation. The Associate Provost may exercise those
responsibilities herself or delegate them to a designee. If at any
time a complaint is filed with a governmental agency or court,
the University procedures must cease immediately.
Columbia College
Graduation
The B.A. degree is typically awarded three times during
the year: in February, May, and October. Under special
circumstances, a degree scheduled to be awarded in May may be
awarded in June instead.
Each May, the College celebrates the students who have
completed the requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree from
Columbia College in its Class Day ceremony. Information on
the College’s Class Day is shared each Spring with students
who have completed or will complete the requirements for the
Bachelor of Arts degree in the academic year ending that May.
Each May, the University confers degrees on the students
who have completed the requirements for the Bachelor of
Arts degree from Columbia College in the University-wide
Commencement ceremony (see Academic Calendar). For
complete Commencement information, please visit the official
Columbia University Commencement website.
Diplomas are mailed to students after the degree has been
officially conferred by the University.
Graduation Requirements
You should consult with your academic advisor within
your school or department to be sure all of your graduation
requirements have been met. In order to be eligible to graduate,
Columbia College students must have completed 124 points of
academic credit, which must include the full Core Curriculum
and all requirements for a major, and must have a cumulative
GPA of 2.0 or higher.
Students in Columbia College can use the Degree Audit Report
(DAR) through SSOL. The DAR is used by both students
and staff as a tool to help track students' progress toward the
degree. The DAR is a tool for advising and is not considered
the equivalent of an official transcript by the College or the
University.
Note: Deans and advisors are the final authorities on whether
graduation requirements have been met.
Degree/Certificate Application
In order to be considered for a degree or certificate,
you must file an application with your school or

Notice of Non-Discrimination
Columbia University is committed to providing a learning,
living, and working environment free from unlawful
discrimination and to fostering a nurturing and vibrant
community founded upon the fundamental dignity and worth
of all of its members. Consistent with this commitment, and
with all applicable laws, it is the policy of the University not

orientation, gender identity, gender expression, national origin,
disability, military status, or any other legally protected status
in the administration of its educational policies, admissions

beliefs will be given an equivalent opportunity to register for
classes or make up any examination, study, coursework or class
requirements that he or she may have missed because of such
absence on any particular day or days.
No student will be penalized for absence due to religious beliefs,
and alternative means will be sought for satisfying the academic
requirements involved.
Officers of Administration and of Instruction responsible for
scheduling of academic activities or essential services are
expected to avoid conflict with religious holidays as much
as possible. If a suitable arrangement cannot be worked out
between the student and the instructor involved, they should
consult the appropriate dean or director. If an additional appeal
is needed, it may be taken to the Provost.

The Study of American Studies
The Center for American Studies offers students the opportunity
to explore the experiences and values of the people of the United
States as embodied in their history, literature, politics, art, and
other enduring forms of cultural expression. The Center views
civic education as its primary mission, sponsoring seminars
and public programs that enhance students’ understanding
of the fundamental ideas and vocabulary of public discourse
in American culture, history, and politics. The Center is the
institutional home of the American Studies program, which
offers an interdisciplinary, seminar-based curriculum designed to
be open and flexible while preparing students for a life of active
citizenship.
Student Advising
Each American Studies major or concentrator chooses an
academic adviser who monitors their progress through
graduation. Students work with advisors to develop programs
tailored to their particular interests. Advisors approve Plan of
Study forms and provide general guidance regarding the major
and concentration. Each student is expected to meet with an
advisor at least once a semester.
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Senior Research Project
The final requirement for the major in American Studies is
completion of a senior essay, to be submitted in the spring of
senior year.
Alternatively, students may fulfill this requirement by taking

Guidance for Undergraduate
Students in the Department
Program Planning for all Students
Students may choose American Studies as an undergraduate
major or a concentration. A minimum of 9 courses is required
to complete the major, 7 courses to complete the concentration.
Coursework for both consists of a combination of required
courses (see degree requirements below) and an individualized
program of study.
Although students generally declare their major or concentration
in the spring of their sophomore year, you may want to take
electives early on in areas that interest you but that will later
connect with the American Studies major.
Undergraduate Programs of
Study
Major in American Studies
A minimum of nine courses is required to complete the major.
Please note that as of January 2018 Major requirements have
changed, beginning with the Class of 2020. Please consult with
the department if there are any questions.

Additional Courses
Four courses drawn from at least two departments, one
of which must be in History and one of which must deal
primarily with some aspect of American experience before
1900. (A course in U.S. History before 1900 would fulfill
both requirements.)
Senior Research Project
The final requirement for the major in American Studies
is completion of a senior essay, to be submitted in the
spring of senior year. Alternatively, students may fulfill this
requirement by taking an additional seminar in which a major
paper is required or by writing an independent essay under the
supervision of a faculty member. Seniors who wish to do a
senior research project are required to take the Senior Project
Colloquium AMST UN3920 in the fall of the senior year.
Minor in American Studies
A minimum of five courses is required to complete the minor.
Minors will be required to take the core introductory course
required for Majors, one American Studies seminar, and three
additional courses:

Minors are required to take the core lecture course
AMST UN1010 INTRO TO AMERICAN STUDIES
This course is an interdisciplinary exploration of the values and
cultural expressions of the people of the United States from the
Puritans to our own time. Students will examine a variety of
works in literature, history, and cultural criticism, with an eye to
understanding how Americans of different backgrounds, living
at different times and in different locations, have understood and
argued about the meaning and significance of American national
identity. Lectures and readings will give particular attention to
the sites—real and imagined—where Americans have identified
the promise and perils of American life. Two lectures each week
and a required weekly discussion section.

The Study of African American
and African Diaspora Studies
The African American studies curriculum explores the historical,
cultural, social, and intellectual contours of the development of
people of African descent. The curriculum enables students to
master the basic foundations of interdisciplinary knowledge in
the humanities and social sciences in the Courses examine the
cultural character of the African diaspora; its social institutions
and political movements; its diversity in thought, belief systems,
and spiritual expressions; and the factors behind the continuing
burden of racial inequality. During their junior and senior
years of study, students focus their research within a specific
discipline or regional study relevant to the African diaspora.
Students should consider a major in African American and
African Diaspora studies if they are interested in careers where
strong liberal arts preparation is needed, such as fields in the
business, social service, or government sectors. Depending on
one’s area of focus within the major, the African American and
African Diaspora studies program can also prepare individuals
for career fields like journalism, politics, public relations, and
other lines of work that involve investigative skills and working
with diverse groups. A major in African American and African
Diaspora studies can also train students in graduate research
skills and methods, such as archival research, and is very useful
for individuals who are considering an advanced graduate degree
such as the Ph.D.
Departmental Honors
The requirements for departmental honors in African American
and African Diaspora studies are as follows:
1. All requirements for major must be completed by graduation
date;
2. Minimum GPA of 3.6 in the major;
3. Completion of senior thesis—due to the director of
undergraduate studies on the first Monday in April.
A successful thesis for departmental honors must be selected
as the most outstanding paper of all papers reviewed by the
thesis committee in a particular year. The Thesis Evaluation
Committee is comprised of department faculty and led by
the director of undergraduate studies. The thesis should be of
superior quality, clearly demonstrating originality and excellent
scholarship, as determined by the committee. Normally no more
than 10% of graduating majors receive departmental honors in a
given academic year.
The African American and
African Diaspora Studies
Department Thesis
Although the senior thesis is a prerequisite for consideration
for departmental honors, all African American and African
Diaspora studies majors are strongly encouraged to consider
undertaking thesis work even if they are ineligible or do not wish
to be considered for departmental honors. The senior thesis gives
undergraduate majors the opportunity to engage in rigorous,
independent, and original research on a specific topic of their
choosing, the result of which is a paper of 35-60 pages in length.
The senior thesis must be written under the supervision of at
least one faculty member. Should the thesis writer elect to have
more than one thesis adviser (either from the outset or added
on during the early stages of research), these faculty in the
aggregate comprise the Thesis Committee, of which one faculty
member must be designated chair. In either case, it is incumbent
upon the thesis writer to establish with the thesis chair and
committee a reasonable schedule of deadlines for submission of
outlines, chapters, bibliographies, drafts, etc.
In many cases, thesis writers may find that the most optimal
way in which to complete a thesis is to formally enroll in an
AFAS independent study course with their thesis adviser as
the instructor. All third year students interested in writing a
thesis should notify the director of undergraduate studies
and submit the name of the faculty adviser ideally by
October 1, but certainly no later than the end of the fall
semester of their junior year. In close consultation with the
thesis adviser, students develop a viable topic, schedule of
meetings, bibliography, and timeline for completion (including
schedule of drafts and outlines).
181African American and African Diaspora Studies
Departmental Prizes
Ralph Johnson Bunche Award for Leadership and Service
The Bunche Award recognizes an undergraduate who has
demonstrated a tremendous capacity for leadership and provided
distinguished service to the Institute for Research in African
American Studies.
The award is named in honor of Ralph Johnson Bunche
(1901-1971), the highest American official in the United
Nations. For his conduct of negotiations leading to an armistice
in the First Arab-Israeli War, he received the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1950; he was the first African American recipient of this
honor.
Ella Baker Award for Outstanding Academic Achievement
The Ella Baker Prize is awarded annually to an undergraduate
who has demonstrated academic excellence, intellectual
commitment to the field of African American Studies and who
has written a thesis that advances our understanding of the
African American experience.
The award is named for the brilliant activist, organizer, leader
and Harlem resident, Ella Baker. Baker served as a field
secretary for the NAACP before organizing the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference under the leadership of Dr.
Martin Luther King. Following her departure from SCLC
she helped student activists organize the Student Non-violent
Coordinating Committee. She would serve as an important
mentor to these young people throughout the rest of her life.

Governed Electives
The "governed electives" category must include courses from at
least three different departments, providing an interdisciplinary
background in the field of African-American Studies. (Note:
you cannot count one of your governed electives within your
designated area of study).
Designated Area of Study
A Designated Area of Study, preferably within a distinct
discipline (for example, history, politics, sociology, literature,
anthropology, psychology, etc.). Students may also select
courses within a particular geographical area or region or an
interdisciplinary field of study.
Any of the departmental disciplines (history, political science;
sociology, anthropology, literature, art history; psychology,
religion, music, etc.)
Any of the pertinent area studies (African Studies; Caribbean/
Latin American; Gender Studies; etc.).
Please note that the major/concentrator is not allowed to “create”
or “make up” a designated area of study without the direct
182Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies, and that such
approval must be sought before the student has embarked on
the course of designated area of study, and that such approval
will be granted only in very rare and exceptional cases. Under
no circumstances should the major/concentrator hope to take
a series of courses only later to “create” a Designated Area of
Study around these courses.For students who entered

African American Studies should be taken as early as possible
since it provides the basic foundation for both the major and
minor and introduces other areas of study; some students will
have taken it prior to declaring the minor. The Social Science
and Humanities electives are designed to give students a sense
of interdisciplinary breadth. The designated area of study
courses will give them the intellectual depth in a subfield,
subject or geographic area and many be taken as they advance in
the minor.

The Study of Ancient Studies
The Interdisciplinary Program in Ancient Studies is administered
by Classics
Classics is the study of the civilizations of ancient Greece and
Rome (c. 900 BCE to 500 CE): their languages, literature,
history, philosophy, art, and ways of life. The purpose of this
program is to enable the student to explore the cultural context
of the ancient Mediterranean as a whole while concentrating on
one specific Mediterranean or Mesopotamian culture. Central
to the concept of the program is its interdisciplinary approach,
in which the student brings the perspectives and methodologies
of at least three different disciplines to bear on his or her area of
specialization.
Faculty participating in the program are scholars specializing
in all aspects of ancient culture and civilization from the
Departments of Anthropology; Art History and Archaeology;
Classics; History; Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African
Studies; Philosophy; and Religion, ensuring that a wide variety
of approaches are available.
Student Advising

Preparing for Graduate Study
https://classics.columbia.edu/preparation-for-graduate-study
Students who are considering graduate work in Classics
should be aware that because our Classics major is not a
pre-professional degree, simply fulfilling the normal major
requirements will not guarantee admission to a graduate
program. By far the most important element in preparation
for graduate school admission is a good command of both the
Latin and the Greek languages, so students who wish to go to
graduate school should attempt to reach the advanced level
in both languages. The two courses at the intermediate level
required in the secondary language for the Classics major are
not enough for admission to most graduate programs, and the
language requirements of both Classical Studies and Ancient
Studies are well below the level normally necessary for graduate
school admission. The importance of languages holds not only
for students wishing to study ancient literature, but also for
those interested primarily in other aspects of the ancient world
(history, art, philosophy, religion, etc.), because it is not possible
to pursue advanced research successfully unless one can make
use of the primary sources. Students who have not done the
requisite amount of language work and wish to go to graduate
school can enroll in a post-baccalaureate program (either at
Columbia or at another institution) to do one or two years of
intensive language work before starting graduate school.
While knowledge of Latin and Greek is the most important
factor in graduate school admission, it is by no means the only
one. Students considering graduate work are also advised to
write a senior thesis (and not to substitute the thesis for any
of the other advanced courses). If possible, it is a good idea to
use some of your summers (especially the one between junior
and senior year) on a relevant activity such as archaeological
fieldwork experience, travel and/or study in Greece or Italy,
learning French or German, improving your Latin or Greek, or
working as a research assistant for a Classicist. It is also useful
to get high scores on the GRE test, and these are best achieved
by obtaining and studying information on the types of questions
asked on the test and taking practice tests.
The department does offer a combined BA/MA program in
Classics allowing them to complete the MA in Classics within
one year of receiving their BA.
Students starting in the Major should start with the language
placement exam to determine the appropriate language level for
their prior knowledge. Exams are administered in late August by
the Department of Classics. Students who cannot take the exam
should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies to make
arrangements.The array of graduate degrees on offer in the US and abroad
can be bewildering—including master’s and doctoral programs
in Classics and a variety of related subjects—and the character
and quality of graduate programs differs widely. It is therefore
important to gather information and seek advice.
For those students who are starting the major without prior
knowledge of the ancient languages please start at the beginningIf you are considering graduate work, you should discuss your
plans with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and other
faculty members no later than the beginning of the fall semester
184Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
before you hope to apply (i.e., typically the fall of your senior
year).Some Classics courses can be used to count toward the Global
Core requirement as noted in the course information.

The Department of Classics at Columbia and the Department
of Classics and Ancient Studies at Barnard College work
closely together. Students may take courses at Barnard to count
towards the Major or Minor. Students at Barnard should speak
to their advisor at Barnard regarding Columbia courses as the
departments are distinct and the requirements for their respective
majors are different.Students are required to take the Major Seminar UN3996 as part
of the program. The course focuses on the preparation for the
Senior Thesis and methods in the field of Classics. Currently
students have the option to participate in a trip abroad to sites in
the ancient world.
Transfer CoursesStudents are encouraged to participate in the Ancient Play put on
yearly by the Barnard Columbia Ancient Drama Group.
Students transferring to Columbia should contact the Director of
Undergraduate Studies to discuss equivalencies and what level
of courses they wish to take.
Study Abroad Courses
Seeing the ancient sites and monuments is an important part of
the study of antiquity, and there are a number of ways to acquire
some familiarity with the physical remains of Greek and Roman
civilization. The Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in
Rome offers in each term an excellent one-semester program,
usually taken in the junior year, and the College Year in Athens
offers a wide variety of courses ranging from language and
literature to history, art, and archaeology. During the summer
there are more options, including the outstanding Summer
Sessions of the American School for Classical Studies in Athens.
A listing of fieldwork opportunities is published annually by the
Archaeological Institute of America.
Summer Courses
Courses are offered over the summer by the department
providing opportunities to study the ancient languages over the
summer.
Courses are also offered in Classical Civilization including
Worlds of Alexander and Classical Mythology.

Students wanting Columbia or Barnard credit for work
done abroad should discuss their plans with the director
of undergraduate studies at an early date to enable them to
incorporate experience abroad most practically into their
programs here.
The Department is able to support a limited number of students
to study ancient languages over the summer through the
Comager Fund and the Undergraduate Latin fund. Interested
students should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies.
Undergraduate students can apply to the SNFPHI Summer
Research Internship in Public Humanities and Hellenic Studies.
This six week internship invites undergraduate students to
explore public humanities, gain hands-on experience with
its objectives, methods, and outcomes, and pursue a group
project that connects research on Greece with a broad public
audience. The internship is structured around: (1) a seminar in
Hellenic Studies in which students explore aspects of modern
Greek history and culture relevant to their internship research,
(2) a workshop in which students are trained in the methods
and tools of public-facing research, and (3) a group project in
which students work closely with Columbia faculty and public
humanities partners in Greece

Departmental Honors are awarded for overall outstanding
performance in the Classics.The director of undergraduate studies is responsible for
overseeing the path of study followed by each student in classics
or classical studies. Through close interaction with the director
of undergraduate studies, as well as with other faculty members
where appropriate, each major is strongly encouraged to debate
the strengths and weaknesses of his or her own trajectory
of study even as the requirements for the major are being
completed.
Academic Prizes
The department offers two prize competitions yearly (Earle and
Romaine) in sight translation of Greek and Latin. These prizes
are awarded on the basis of examinations given each spring.
Two prizes are given to graduating Columbia College seniors:
• The Caverly Prize is awarded annually for outstanding
performance by a graduating Columbia College major.
• The Stadler Prize is awarded annually to a graduating senior
of Columbia College who is judged by the faculty to have
demonstrated academic excellence through course work and
the writing of a senior essay on some aspect of the history or
culture of the classical world.
Other Important Information
Students interested in majoring in Ancient Studies should reach

an understanding of a culture is through the actual words of
its people. Those considering graduate work on the ancient
world should also be aware that most graduate schools require
more than two years of undergraduate language training for
admission.
The language offered in fulfillment of this requirement should
generally match the student’s area of cultural concentration;
special arrangements are available with other universities for
students whose cultural concentration require languages not
normally taught at Columbia.
Students entering with expertise in their chosen languages are
placed in advanced courses as appropriate but are still required
to complete at least two semesters of language courses at
Columbia; exceptions to this policy may be made in the case
of languages not normally taught at Columbia. Language
courses at the 1100-level may not be counted toward the
major. Language courses, including those at the 1100-level,
must be taken for a letter grade.
**Relevant introductory courses are offered by the Department
of Classics or from offerings in the Programs or Departments
of Ancient Studies, Art History and Archaeology, History,
Philosophy, or Religion. Students should confirm a course's
relevance with the director of undergraduate studies as soon as
possible.

The Study of Anthropology
Anthropology at Columbia is the oldest department of
anthropology in the United States. Founded by Franz Boas in
1896 as a site of academic inquiry inspired by the uniqueness of
cultures and their histories, the department fosters expansiveness
of thought and independence of intellectual pursuit.
Cross-cultural interpretation, global socio-political
considerations, a markedly interdisciplinary approach, and
a willingness to think otherwise have formed the spirit of
anthropology at Columbia. Boas himself wrote widely on pre-
modern cultures and modern assumptions, on language, race, art,
dance, religion, politics, and much else, as did his remarkable
graduate students including, Ruth Benedict, Zora Neal Hurston,
Edward Sapir, Manuel Gamio, Alfred Kroeber, Ella Deloria and
Margaret Mead, among others.
In these current times of increasing global awareness, a spirit of
mindful interconnectedness guides the department. Professors
of anthropology at Columbia today write widely on colonialism
and postcolonialism; on matters of gender, theories of history,
knowledge, and power; on language, law, magic, mass-
mediated cultures, modernity, and flows of capital and desire;
on nationalism, ethnic imaginations, and political contestations;
on material cultures and environmental conditions; on ritual,
performance, and the arts; and on semiotics, linguistics,
symbolism, and questions of representation. Additionally, they
write across worlds of similarities and differences concerning
the Middle East, China, Africa, the Caribbean, Japan, Latin
America, South Asia, Europe, Southeast Asia, North America,
and other increasingly transnational and technologically virtual
conditions of being.
The Department of Anthropology traditionally offered courses
and majors in three main areas: sociocultural anthropology,
archaeology, and biological/physical anthropology. While the
sociocultural anthropology program now comprises the largest
part of the department and accounts for the majority of faculty
and course offerings, archaeology is also a vibrant program
within anthropology whose interests overlap significantly
with those of sociocultural anthropology. Biological/physical
anthropology has shifted its program to the Department
of Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology. The
Anthropology Department enthusiastically encourages cross-
disciplinary dialogue across disciplines as well as participation
in study abroad programs.
Sociocultural Anthropology
At the heart of sociocultural anthropology is an exploration
of the possibilities of difference and the craft of writing.
Sociocultural anthropology at Columbia has emerged as a
compelling undergraduate liberal arts major. Recently, the
number of majors in sociocultural anthropology has more than
tripled.
Students come to sociocultural anthropology with a wide
variety of interests, often pursuing overlapping interests in, for
example, performance, religion, writing, law, ethnicity, mass-
media, teaching, language, literature, history, human rights,
art, linguistics, environment, medicine, film, and many other
fields, including geographical areas of interest and engagement.
Such interests can be brought together into provocative and
productive conversation with a major or concentration in
sociocultural anthropology. The requirements for a major in
sociocultural anthropology reflect this intellectual expansiveness
and interdisciplinary spirit.
Archaeology
Archaeologists study the ways in which human relations are
mediated through material conditions, both past and present.
Particular emphases in the program include the development
of ancient states and empires, especially in the indigenous
Americas; the impact of colonial encounters on communities
in the American Southwest, the Levant and Africa; and human-
animal relations in prehistory, religion and ritual, and the
archaeology of the dead.
Themes in our teaching include the political, economic,
social, and ideological foundations of complex societies; and
archaeological theory and its relationship to broader debates
in social theory, technology studies, and philosophy. Faculty
members also teach and research on questions of museum
representations, archaeological knowledge practices, and
the socio-politics of archaeology. The program includes the
possibility of student internships in New York City museums
and archaeological fieldwork in the Americas and elsewhere.
In addition to the Major/Minor in Archaeology within
the Anthropology Department, students can choose the
interdisciplinary Major/Minor in Archaeology. All students
188Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
with interests in archaeology are invited to sign up to the
undergraduate archaeology list serv and are welcome to events
organized by the Center for Archaeology.
Student Advising
Majors and concentrators should consult the director of
undergraduate studies when entering the department and
devising programs of study. Students may also seek academic
advice from any anthropology faculty member, as many faculty
members hold degrees in several fields or positions in other
departments and programs at Columbia. All faculty in the
department are committed to an expansiveness of thought and an
independence of intellectual pursuit and advise accordingly.

The Study of Archaeology
Archaeology is the study of the material conditions inhabited
and acted upon by people in the past and present. As an
academic discipline, archaeology has come to mean many
things to different generations of scholars, yet all approaches
share in common a focus on the physical remains of the past
and on the interpretive acts that enliven these remains and are
challenged by them. Investigation of the past through the study
of material remains is entangled with historiography, politics,
and individual and collective memory, and is implicated in
the production of present-day communities and identities. At
Columbia, archaeology is a multidisciplinary field practiced
by faculty and students in the humanities, social sciences, and
natural sciences.
Archaeology is everywhere! Students and faculty at Columbia
have done archaeological fieldwork and research program
around the world, including: Argentina, Peru, Central America,
the North American Southwest, New York City, upstate New
York, the UK, France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Yemen,
Israel, Palestine, Armenia, and Madagascar. Archaeologists
at Columbia also work with professionals at a wide range of
institutions in New York. Among the institutions at which
students in particular programs may conduct research, or work
on internships, are the American Museum of Natural History,
the Brooklyn Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the
Museum of the City of New York, the National Museum of
the American Indian, the New York Botanical Garden, and the
South Street Seaport Museum.
The inter-departmental major in archaeology is an
interdisciplinary program that allows students to take
archaeology classes from a wide range of departments at
Columbia and Barnard, including Anthropology, Art History,
Classics, EALAC, History, EEEB and others. Students can
put together a major that reflects their particular interests. This
major has a strong focus on lab and field skills, as well as on
questions of interpretation and theory.
Interdepartmental Major in Archaeology
Students interested in archaeology should sign up for the
archaeology list-serv, for announcements about courses,
events, and summer research opportunities: https://
listserv.cuit.columbia.edu/scripts/wa.exe?SUBED1=ARCY-

Advising events such as open houses and welcome events, as
well as Friday Open Lab hours will be announced on the listserv.
Other information about advising and the major and minor can
be found on the CCA’s website:
https://archaeology.columbia.edu/undergraduate/major/
https://archaeology.columbia.edu/undergraduate/minor/
Enrolling in Classes
Majoring or minoring in archaeology does not require any
prerequisite coursework.
Requirements for enrolling in specific archaeology courses will
vary by department and instructor.
Preparing for Graduate Study
Students interested in pursuing graduate study in archaeology
or other disciplines that include archaeologists are encourage
to consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies or other
archaeology faculty at Columbia and Barnard.
Requirements and preparation for graduate study in archaeology
are discipline-specific and vary between archaeology, art history,
anthropology, classics, and other regional studies departments
and programs. Some programs of study may require language
training and language courses may be counted as part of the
“related courses” for the major.
Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Coursework in fulfillment of a major or minor must be taken at
Columbia University unless
explicitly noted here and/or expressly permitted by the Director
of Undergraduate Studies of the program. Exceptions or
191Archaeology
substitutions permitted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies
should be confirmed in writing by email to the student.submit their transcript after completion of the course. See the
section on “Transfer Courses” for more detailed information.
Advanced PlacementSummer courses at Columbia are offered through the School of
Professional Studies. Courses taken in a Summer Term may be
used toward requirements for the major/minor only as articulated
in department/institute/center guidelines or by permission of
the Director(s) of Undergraduate Studies. More general policies
about Summer coursework can be found in the Academic
Regulations section of this Bulletin.
Advanced Placement credits are not accepted towards the major
or the minor in archaeology.
Barnard College Courses
Courses taken at Barnard are treated as part of the available
curriculum and count towards the major/minor, as long as they
meet the relevant criteria to count towards the major/minor.
Transfer Courses
When students transfer to Columbia from other institutions, their
coursework at their previous institution must first be considered
by their school in order to be evaluated
for degree credit (e.g., to confirm that the courses will count
toward the 124 points of credit that every student is required to
complete for the B.A. degree). Only after that degree credit is
confirmed, departments may consider whether those courses
can also be used to fulfill specific degree requirements toward a
major or minor.
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Undergraduate Research Courses
The interdepartmental major encourages students to explore
the wide-range of field and laboratory methods used by
archaeologists. Think like an Archaeologist (UN2028), one of
required introductory courses, introduces students to the basics
of archaeological research and methods.
Students majoring in archaeological can take a wide range of
courses to fulfill the field
Up to two courses for the major may be fulfilled with transfer
credit.Work/internship and laboratory class requirements – and should
consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies about the
available courses and individual research interests.
Students are allowed to apply 1 course (up to 4 credits) of
transfer coursework to the minor.Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
For both the major and the minor, students may undertake a
fieldwork course (usually done in the summer) that offers credit
through another university and that will be counted towards the
program of study, separately from any prior transfer courses.
Study Abroad Courses
Classes taken abroad through Columbia#led programs (i.e.,
those administered by Columbia’s Center for Undergraduate
Global Engagement and taught by Columbia
instructors) are treated as Columbia courses, equivalent to
those taken on the Morningside Heights campus. If they are not
explicitly listed by the department as fulfilling requirements in
the major or minor, the DUS will need to confirm that they can
be used toward requirements in the major/minor.
Classes taken abroad through other institutions and programs
are treated as transfer credit to Columbia, and are subject to the
same policies as other transfer courses. There will be a limit on
the number of courses taken abroad that can be applied to the
major/minor, and they must be approved by the DUS.
Summer Courses
Students doing summer field school courses that are affiliated
with other universities need to get pre-approval from the
Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students will need to provide
a syllabus for the course prior to approval and will need to
Writing a senior thesis is optional, but recommended for
students who are interested in pursuing a graduate degree or who
want to be eligible for departmental honors.
Thesis topics should be discussed with a faculty adviser during
the junior year, allowing time for planning, research, and travel
during the following summer. In the senior year, students may
register for two semesters of senior thesis study with their
adviser (e.g., ANTH 3997 or AHIS 3997–3998), to cover the
writing of the thesis, the final draft of which must be submitted
by March 25th.
Undergraduate Research Outside of Courses
Most semesters the Columbia Center for Archaeology runs
open lab hours on Fridays, where students can drop in and
volunteer on faculty and graduate student research projects.
Announcements about the open lab will be circulated on the

Departmental Honors and
Prizes
Department Honors
To be considered for departmental honors, majors must:
1. Have grade point average of at least 3.6 in major courses
2. Completed an honors thesis or equivalent project of high
quality
Academic Prizes
The Ralph and Rose Solecki Award is given in honor of the
eminent Columbia archaeologists. The Award is given to a
student, chosen by the faculty, who has made a significant
contribution to the life of the archaeological community at
Columbia and/or Barnard in the preceding year. The Solecki
award is usually made to a graduating student, but it is open to
all students in archaeology regardless of their status.
The award comes with a small sum of money intended for
books.
Other Important Information
The Archaeology program at Columbia is housed in the Center
for Archaeology and taught by faculty who come from a range
of different backgrounds. The interdepartmental major/minor
in archaeology was developed as a truly interdisciplinary
approach to archaeology, taking advantage of the full scope of
archaeological expertise on offer at Columbia University.
In addition, it is also possible to study archaeology as part of
majoring in Anthropology or Art History, among other options.
If you are not sure which course of study to choose, make an
appointment to talk with the Director of Undergraduate Studies.

rgarciag@barnard.eduStudents interested in obtaining a professional degree in
Architecture continue on to graduate programs after their
undergraduate degree, and students from the Barnard Columbia
program have enjoyed enormous success in their admissions to
the most competitive graduate programs in the country. Students
who study Architecture as undergraduates have also pursued
graduate degrees in a variety of disciplines including Urban
Planning, Law, and Media and Communications.
The Study of ArchitectureMission
Studying Architecture at Barnard College, Columbia College,
and General Studies leads to a liberal arts degree – a Bachelor
of Arts with a major in Architecture, and Barnard College is the
administrative location for all undergraduate architecture studies
at Columbia University and its partner institutions. A liberal arts
education in architecture holds a unique position in academia
and in relation to the discipline. If the goal of a professional
education in architecture is to enable students to participate
directly in the world as an architect – a liberal arts education
asks that students consider the broader and myriad conditions
in which architecture is conceived and practiced and, in turn, to
understand how architecture inevitably alters those conditions.
Students are asked to confront and interpret the complex social,
cultural, political, and environmental processes that weave
through architectural design and urbanism. The purpose of an
undergraduate liberal arts degree in architecture is to educate
students to think about the world through architecture.The Architecture major establishes an intellectual context
for students to interpret the relation of form, space, program,
materials, and media to human life and thought. Through the
Architecture curriculum, students participate in the ongoing
shaping of knowledge about the built environment and learn
to see architecture as one among many forms of cultural
production. At the same time, the major stresses the necessity
of learning disciplinary-specific tools, methods, terms and
critiques. Thus, work in the studio, lecture or seminar asks that
students treat architecture as a form of research and speculation
which complement the liberal arts mission of expansive
thinking.
Chair and Director of Undergraduate Studies in
Architecture:
Professor Karen Fairbanks
kfairbanks@barnard.edu
The Architecture curriculum introduces design at a variety
of scales, acknowledging that integrated design thinking is
effective for problem-solving at any scale and in any discipline.
Students will experiment with full-scale installations and devices
and make small-scale models of the built environment from
which they extract, interpret, and invent new possibilities of
inhabitation and use. The curriculum intentionally balances the
traditions of handcrafted representation with evolving digital
technologies of architectural design and communication.
The Architecture major complements, and makes great use of
its University setting. With access to superb libraries, research
centers, graduate programs, and abundant intellectual resources,
our students have the opportunity to follow their creative
instincts to great depth and breadth – and they do. The major
takes full advantage of New York City, utilizing it as a site
Student Learning Outcomes

curriculum should be able to complete the following outcomes:
• Apply integrated design thinking to specific problems in and
beyond the discipline.
• Visually communicate architectural concepts and research
using discipline-specific techniques in multiple media.
• Verbally present independent, group or assigned research, in
multiple media formats.
• Organize and concisely write in a variety of formats
including reports, case studies, synthetic overviews, etc.
• Understand and critically interpret major buildings and
themes of Architectural history and theory.
• Be intellectually prepared for graduate studies in architecture
and related disciplines.

Science (SEAS) students may complete a minor in Architecture.
Student Advising
Advising Resources
Advising Appointments
Our department offers weekly advising appointments for
students who are interested in our courses and potentially
pursuing an architecture major or minor. If you have any
questions or need help interpreting departmental requirements
for the major or minor, please sign up for an appointment with
one of our faculty advisors. Faculty advising appointments are
offered throughout the fall and spring and are open to anyone
who is interested in learning more about our department.
During the summer break, current and prospective students
are instead invited to submit their questions by email to
architecture@barnard.edu.
Major and Minor Advising
After a student has officially declared their major in
architecture, they will be assigned a permanent faculty advisor
in our department who will meet with them once per semester
to review their progress in the major. Although minors are
not formally assigned to a faculty advisor, we welcome and
encourage our minors to meet with our faculty advisors to
address any questions.
Major and Minor Requirements Worksheets
Major and minor worksheets are intended to help students plan
their coursework and the completion of their program of study.
You can download major and minor worksheets here.
The Architecture Department Newsletter
Our department distributes a biweekly newsletter for
architecture students. Students who are enrolled in one of our
courses or who have declared the major in architecture are
automatically subscribed to this newsletter. Those who are not
in our courses and wish to subscribe to our newsletter can do so
here.
Architecture Program Planning Meetings
Our department hosts two program planning meetings per year,
one in October and another in April. At these meetings, students
can learn about our course offerings, the course application
process, and the major and minor requirements. Information
about upcoming program planning meetings can be found on our
website’s events calendar.
Guidance for First-Year Students
For first-year students who are interested in architecture and
design, we offer the following course, which prioritizes first-
year students:
ARCH UN1010 Design Futures: New York City
In addition to taking Design Futures: NYC, first-year students
are encouraged to refer to our program planning lists and review
any lecture courses that can count towards the architecture major
and minor requirements. First-year students are discouraged
from applying for admission to our introductory-level studios
Architectural Design: Systems and Materials or Architectural
Design: Environments and Mediations; these courses are
more appropriate for second and third-year students, and those
students will be given priority for admission to these studios.
Similarly, our required lecture course for the major, ARCH
UN3117 Modern Architecture in the World, can be taken at any
time but is generally recommended for the sophomore year as a
companion course to the first two studios.
Please note that first-year students interested in majoring in
architecture should not enroll in ARCH UN1020 Introduction to
Architectural Design & Visual Culture, as this course is intended
for third and fourth-year students minoring in architecture or
non-majors interested in an architecture studio. This course will
not count toward the architecture major.
To learn more about our courses and department, first-year
students are strongly encouraged to sign up for our faculty
advising appointments.
Enrolling in Courses
Course Applications
Many architecture courses require an application. To receive
full consideration for admission, you must fill out the course
application in advance and also join the online course waitlist
during an early registration period.
Please note that our department will only review applications
and process admissions during specific weeks, with priority

the first week of classes.
Admission to our courses is at the discretion of the department
and instructor. If a student is admitted from the waitlist, their
status on SSOL will change to "Approved." The transition from
the waitlist to the class list will occur automatically overnight.Once available, our list of approved GSAPP courses is uploaded
to this page on our website.
Due to very limited space in our courses, it is possible that a
student who has applied and joined the waitlist during an early
registration window will remain on the waitlist until the start of
classes. Once the semester begins, students who remain on the
waitlist for any of our courses must attend the first class session
and speak with the instructor to inquire about available spots.Advanced Placement Credit
To learn more about our course application process, please visit

Barnard College Courses
Transfer Credit
When students transfer to Columbia from other institutions, their
coursework at their previous institution must first be considered
by their school in order to be evaluated for degree credit (e.g.,
to confirm that the courses will count toward the 124 points of
credit that every student is required to complete for the B.A.
degree). Only after that degree credit is confirmed, departments
may consider whether those courses can also be used to fulfill
specific degree requirements toward a major or minor.
The use of transfer courses toward the major requirements is
determined on a case-by-case basis. Typically, no more than 3
transfer courses will be allowed to fulfill the major requirements,
primarily in the ‘Specialization’ category within the major.
Students requesting a review of up to three courses for transfer
credits should refer to our Request for Exemption from
Architecture Major or Minor Requirements form.
Study Abroad Credit
Classes taken abroad through Columbia-led programs (i.e.,
those administered by Columbia’s Center for Undergraduate
Global Engagement and taught by Columbia instructors) are
treated as Columbia courses, equivalent to those taken on the
Morningside Heights campus. If they are not explicitly listed by
the department as fulfilling requirements in the major or minor,
the student’s major advisor will need to confirm that they can be
used toward requirements in the major or minor.
Classes taken abroad through other institutions and programs
are treated as transfer credit to Columbia and are subject to the
same policies as other transfer courses. Accordingly, the number
of study abroad courses taken at other institutions that can be
counted toward the major or minor will be limited. Typically, no
more than 3 transfer courses will be allowed to fulfill the major
requirements
Students majoring in architecture should meet with their major
advisor, while those minoring in architecture should consult the
199Architecture
DUS. These meetings are necessary to discuss the application of
study abroad courses—whether through a Columbia program or
another institution—to their program of study requirements and
to obtain credit toward their major or minor.
Summer Courses
Summer courses in architecture at Barnard are equivalent to
those taken during the academic year. Courses that have been
approved for the fulfillment of departmental requirements will
automatically count toward the major and minor.
Summer courses at Columbia are offered through the School of
Professional Studies. Courses taken in a Summer Term may be
used toward requirements for the major/minor only as articulated
in department/institute/center guidelines or by permission of
the Director(s) of Undergraduate Studies. More general policies
about Summer coursework can be found in the Academic
Regulations section of this Bulletin.
Students must meet with their major advisor or the DUS for
permission to receive major or minor credit for a summer course
taken at Columbia.

The Study of Art History
A major, minor, or concentration in the Department of Art
History and Archaeology lays the basis for pursuing a variety of
careers in and beyond the scholarly pursuit of the history of art,
museum work, and work in the commercial art world of galleries
and auction houses. The visual study of the world around us
continues to increase in importance as global communication
becomes more often based in visual media, and understanding
the sources and significance of images that form a common
language of communication is crucial for anyone who aspires
to play an active part in society. Art History majors have gone
on to graduate education as well as careers in law, medicine,
business, and academe, among others.
Critical study teaches not only the particulars of the art,
archaeology, and architecture under study, but also the broader
analytical and synthetic skills needed for mature, reasoned, and
inventive solutions to broad#based questions in any field, with
particular emphasis on the analysis of visual culture. As one of
the largest Art History departments in the world, the Columbia–
Barnard faculty include specialists in the art and architecture
of an impressive spectrum of cultures and geographies from
the Ancient Near East to Contemporary Global Art History.
The curriculum offers coursework in the Pre#Columbian New
World; in the art and architecture of Africa, of the Indian
Subcontinent, of China, of Japan; in addition to many aspects
of the art and architecture of North America and Europe,
including African#American and diasporic art, and the art of
First Nations in the Americas. Methodological approaches
offered by the curriculum are equally diverse, including courses
which explicitly address issues of gender and race. Several
members of the faculty have extensive curatorial experience
and regularly offer courses which comprise instruction in the
history of collecting, display, and museum practices. Department
courses take advantage of the extraordinary cultural resources of

their coursework at their previous institution must first be
considered by their school in order to be evaluated for degree
credit (e.g., to confirm that the courses will count toward the
124 points of credit that every student is required to complete
for the B.A. degree). Only after that degree credit is confirmed,
departments may consider whether those courses can also be
used to fulfill specific degree requirements toward a major,
minor, or concentration program.
Study Abroad Courses
Classes taken abroad through other institutions and programs are
treated as transfer credit to Columbia and are subject to the same
policies as other transfer courses. There will be a limit on the
number of courses taken abroad that can be applied to the major,
minor, or concentration, and they must be approved by the DUS.
Summer Courses
Summer courses at Columbia are offered through the School of
Professional Studies. Courses taken in a Summer Term may be
used toward requirements for the major, minor, or concentration
only as articulated in the Department of Art History and
Archaeology guidelines or by permission of the DUS. Please
refer to the Undergraduate Field Distribution Chart, linked from
this page, to confirm which Summer Term courses may count
toward the major, minor, or concentration requirements: https://
arthistory.columbia.edu/content/major-requirements
More general policies about Summer coursework can be found
in the Academic Regulations section of this Bulletin.
Core Curriculum Connections
Students may be interested in course offerings in Art History
that can be taken in fulfillment of the Global Core requirement
of the Core Curriculum. See the list of approved courses on this
page of the Bulletin.
While Art Humanities does not count toward the major, minor,
or concentration requirements, students intending to declare one
of these programs are encouraged to enroll in Art Humanities in
their first or second year.
No more than three transfer courses may be counted toward the
major or the concentration. No more than one transfer course
may be counted toward the minor.
Students should fill out and email a Transfer Credit Request

Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Undergraduate Research in Courses
At the heart of the major is the Majors Colloquium (AHIS
UN3000 INTRO LIT/METHODS OF ART HIST) which
introduces students to different methodological approaches to
Art History and critical texts that have shaped the discipline.
This course also prepares students for the independent research
required in seminars and advanced lecture courses, and should
be taken during junior year.
Sign-up information for Art History majors will be circulated via
the department listserv.
The Majors Colloquium cannot be substituted by a transfer
course.
Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
The Senior Thesis is an optional project open to Art History,
History & Theory of Architecture, and combined Art History
+Visual Arts majors. It is a year#long project encompassing the
senior year, as well as the summer before, and will consume
much of winter break and all of spring break. Substantial
research and preparation is completed in the summer before
the senior year. Submitting a senior thesis qualifies students to
compete for departmental honors and (indirectly) strengthens
dossiers for university honors. It is also an opportunity for
students interested in graduate school to build their academic
resumes and experience the intensity and rewards of graduate-
style research.
Prospective thesis writers should have a GPA of at least
3.7 in art history courses and should have completed at
least six courses counting toward the major requirements,
preferably including at least one seminar. The DUS reviews the
applications with the goal of ensuring that the student has the
academic qualifications to succeed and has identified a credible
project. Deadlines will be posted on the department website and
circulated on the listserv.
Undergraduate Research Outside of Courses
Students interested in exploring a specific topic with a faculty
member may choose to pursue an independent study project.
Students should contact the faculty member who they would
like to work with directly. If the faculty member agrees to
supervise the independent study, the faculty member will contact
the Undergraduate Program Coordinator to have the student
registered. Students may complete an independent study project
for 3 points. Independent studies typically count toward lecture
credit; exceptions may be made with the approval of the DUS.
Department Honors and Prizes
Department Honors
To be considered for departmental honors, students must have a
GPA of at least 3.7 in classes for the major and have submitted
a senior thesis of distinction. The faculty of the Department of
Art History and Archaeology submits recommendations to the
Committee on Honors, Awards, and Prizes for confirmation.
Normally, no more than ten percent of the graduating majors in
the department receive departmental honors.
All thesis writers are required to enroll in the year#long (YC)
course AHIS UN3002 Senior Thesis Seminar, which is offered
as a 3#point seminar in the fall and a 3#point seminar in the
spring. This 6#point year#long seminar may substitute for a
single elective lecture course. Students receive a grade at the
end of the spring term which is applied to both semesters of
the seminar. If a student withdraws after the fall term, they will
receive a P/F grade for the fall term which cannot be applied to
the major.Academic Prizes
Securing faculty sponsorship is critical. Speaking with potential
advisors during the spring semester of junior year (or earlier)
is highly recommended. With approval of the DUS, students
may work with a faculty sponsor outside the department. Written
confirmation from the advisor is due in May of junior year. In
August, students who have secured faculty sponsorship must
submit the Senior Thesis Proposal based on research completed
over the summer, which includes a proposal of about 400 words,
an annotated bibliography, and the signature of the faculty
sponsor.Professors
The Senior Thesis Prize is awarded annually for a senior
thesis of superior distinction.
The Judith Lee Stronach Memorial Prize is awarded for
outstanding contributions in art history or archaeology by a
General Studies student.

Guidance for Undergraduate
Students in the Department
Program Planning for all Students
Students who entered Columbia (as first-year students or
as transfer students) in or after Fall 2024 may select from a
curriculum of majors and minors. The requirements for the
Bachelor of Arts degree, and role of majors and minors in those
requirements, can be found in the Academic Requirements
section of the Bulletin dated the academic year when the student
matriculated at Columbia and the Bulletin dated the academic
year when the student was a sophomore and declared programs
of study.
Students who entered Columbia in or before the 2023-2024
academic year may select from a curriculum of majors and
minors and concentrations. The requirements for the Bachelor
of Arts degree, and the role of majors and minors in those
requirements, can be found in the Academic Requirements
section of the Bulletin dated the academic year when the student
matriculated at Columbia and the Bulletin dated the academic
year when the student was a sophomore and declared programs
of study.
When selecting courses in the Department of Art History and
Archaeology, students should keep in mind the specifics of
course types, distribution requirements, and required coursework
as outlined below.
Course Numbering Structure
1000-level courses are broad survey lectures open to all
undergraduate students. They do not count toward a historical or
geographical requirement, though they may count as an elective
lecture (or as a required course for HTAC programs, in the case
of AHIS UN1007).
2000-level courses are survey lectures focusing on a particular
subject area. They are open to all students.
3000-level courses are seminars open to undergraduate students
only. Seminars
are limited#enrollment classes which offer students the
opportunity to explore a topic in#depth with the instruction
of a faculty member who is an expert in that field. Seminars
typically require intensive reading and discussion, culminating
in an extended research paper and oral presentation. Students
must submit an application to be considered for enrollment in a
seminar.
4000-4499–level courses are advanced bridge lectures open to
undergraduate and graduate students. While instructor approval
is not required, undergraduates are expected to have some
background in the subject of the course.
4500-4999–level courses are advanced bridge seminars open
to undergraduate and graduate students. As with undergraduate
207Art History and Archaeology
seminars, these courses require an application. Advanced
knowledge within a field is typically expected. If you have
questions about the suitability of a course, please contact the
instructor to discuss your qualifications.
Guidance for First-Year Students
There is no required sequence for completing a major, minor,
or concentration in the department. However, first-year students
interested in declaring one of these programs are encouraged to
take Art Humanities in their first or second year. Students are
also encouraged to take several 1000- and/or 2000-level survey
lectures before applying for seminars in their junior and senior
years.
Guidance for Transfer Students
There is no required sequence for completing a major, minor,
or concentration in the department. However, transfer students
interested in declaring one of these programs are encouraged
to take Art Humanities earlier rather than later. Transfer
students who want to transfer coursework in art history from
a previous institution toward their program of study are
strongly encouraged to meet with the Undergraduate Program
Coordinator as soon as possible to submit these requests.

Astronomy is, at once, the oldest science and one of the most
vibrant fields of modern research. Its goal is to construct
testable, quantitative, coherent models of the universe (the
UNIty of the diVERSE) and its contents-galaxies, stars, and
planets. The department offers two majors, both of which require
a solid grounding in the mathematics and physics necessary for
the pursuit of the discipline.Enrolling in Classes
Student AdvisingPreparing for Graduate Study
Professor Frederik (Frits) Paerels (DUS), 1022 Pupin,
frits@astro.columbia.eduThe astrophysics major is designed as preparation for graduate
study and consists of a standard physics major sequence;
a yearlong introduction to astrophysics (typically taken in
the sophomore year, but open to first-years with adequate
preparation in calculus and physics); and two required courses
covering advanced topics in astronomy. Research, in the
form of summer internships and/or term-time independent
projects, which can lead to a senior thesis, is strongly
encouraged. For a research thesis, students should enroll
in the parallel, two-semester sequence ASTR UN3997-
ASTR UN3998 INDEPENDENT RESEARCH , preferably in
their senior year. Students begin the research project in the fall
and complete the written thesis in the spring.
Consulting Advisers
We mostly do advising on an individual basis. You can stop
by during office hours (changing, check the department
Undergraduate Advising page: https://www.astro.columbia.edu/

the DUS (email). The DUS encourages you to come by in person
and talk, and limit ‘email advising’. We get to know you better
that way (and you us), and the DUS can talk much faster than he
can type.
You can sign up for our general department events email list:
send email to listserv@lists.columbia.edu and include this line

There are no specific steps, prerequisites, or placement tests
to enroll in any astronomy classes, other than the ones that are
listed in the Bulletin (e.g. you should have taken basic calculus
before enrolling in the Introductory Physics Sequence, and the
Introduction to Astrophysics sequence).
The astronomy major provides a basis for further study in the
field, but is also designed to be compatible with liberal arts
students who pursue other careers and those wishing to combine
astronomy with related sciences other than physics, such as
chemistry or geology. It requires only two physics courses
beyond the introductory sequence and can be completed easily if
begun in the sophomore year.

Program Planning for all Students
If you are interested in pursuing a Major in Astronomy or
Astrophysics, make an appointment with the DUS to discuss
a course of study, and do this early. The programs can in
principle be completed in two years- but only if you have
already completed almost all other requirements. Most students
prefer to start on Major-required courses in their first and/
or second year. You can find an example schedule here:
https://www.astro.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/
docs/Suggested%20Sequence%20of%20Courses%20for
%20Majors.pdf
212Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
There is an implied progressive structure to some of the courses:
for instance, taking the Introductory Physics Sequence means
you should have taken basic Calculus. Likewise, starting on the
Introduction to Astrophysics sequence means you know basic,
calculus-based physics. If in doubt about the flexibility of the
schedule, talk to the DUS.
Courses in which the grade of D has been received do not count
toward the major, minor, or concentration requirements.
Undergraduate Programs of
Study
Required Coursework for all Programs
Common to both the Astronomy and the Astrophysics Major are
the Calculus sequence and an Introductory Physics sequence (the
Physics 1400, 1600, or 2800 series).
Course Numbering Structure
The 1000-level courses do not use calculus (but they are
quantitative!), and are meant to provide an overview of fields of
astronomy and astrophysics for non-major students. They can all
count towards fulfilling the science requirements for non-science
majors. With one exception (see under the Astronomy Major),
the 1000-level courses can not be counted towards the credits for
an Astrophysics or Astronomy Major.
The 2000-level courses (Introduction to Astrophysics I and
II) provide an overview of astrophysics at the introductory
professional level: calculus based, physics-based.
3000-level courses in the Astronomy department are more
advanced electives. They generally assume you are familiar with
the content of the 2000-level courses. Most 3000-level courses,
as well as ASTR GU4260 MODELING THE UNIVERSE,
are offered every other year. Students should inquire with the
director of undergraduate studies if they have specific questions
on the course schedule. ASTR UN3996 Current Research in
Astrophysics is a one-point course offered in the fall, designed
to introduce majors to research methods and topics. It requires
students to attend the department colloquia and a seminar
designed to help students understand the colloquium topic. The
3000-level courses need not be taken in any particular order.
4000-level courses are aimed at advanced undergraduates and
beginning graduate students.
Guidance for First-Year Students
If you think you may want to pursue a Major in Astronomy or
Astrophysics, come talk to the DUS. If you have to make quick
decisions by yourself: the rule of thumb is: start with the Math
requirements, the next priority is Introductory Physics, then
Astrophysics and Astronomy.
Guidance for Transfer Students
The standard Columbia College rules for transfer credit apply.
You should contact the DUS as soon as you know you are
transferring to plan for what will probably be a tight program
(depending in what year you transfer, but especially when you
start as a junior).
If you are considering applying to graduate school, we need to
make sure, in particular, that you get to do an individual research
project.

Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Advanced Placement
If you got a 5 on the AP biology test, you get 3 points
of credit toward graduation. Students with a 5 on
the AP should take BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I:
BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC and BIOL UN2006 INTRO BIO
II:CELL BIO,DEV/PHYS.
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Undergraduate Research in Courses
SURF
BIOL UN2005-UN2006 is not a repeat of AP bio. It
demands not only more detail but more thought and
application of knowledge to problem-solving than the
usual AP course. It is narrower but deeper than the usual
introductory biology course. You may review this exam
from a previous year of UN2005 and compare your answers
with the exam key. This will give you an idea of what
makes UN2005/6 a unique Intro Bio sequence. If you still
feel that you are sufficiently prepared, please consult a
biology advisor who on rare occasions can give permission
to place out of Intro Bio I and II. You will still be required
to take 6 biology courses at Columbia if you place out of
Intro Bio.
First-year students, sophomores, and juniors are eligible
for the department’s paid internship program (SURF). This
program is competitive; the department cannot assure every
eligible student a place in any given summer.
A faculty committee headed by Dr. Alice Heicklen then
matches selected students to appropriate labs. The deadline
for SURF applications is at the beginning of the spring
semester.
SURF students must submit a report on their work at the
end of the summer session and participate in the following
year’s annual Undergraduate Research Symposium.
Although it does not carry any academic credit, SURF can
be used toward the lab requirement for majors and toward
graduation with honors.
Current detailed descriptions of the SURF program and
the application procedure are available at SURF's website,
https://biology.columbia.edu/content/surf.
For more information on the Amgen Scholarship Program,
please visit https://biology.columbia.edu/content/amgen-
scholars-program. Applications to all of these programs are
through SURF.
Barnard College Courses
Barnard courses may not be substituted for the required
Columbia courses without advance permission from the
advisor. Students may not use Barnard courses for the
biology minor.
Transfer Courses
Transfer credits for the majors, concentrators, and the
biology minor are not automatically granted. Students
should email their Biology advisor with a transcript and the
syllabi from their previous institution to request transfer
credit. Transfer credit for Introductory Biology is rarely
granted. You can read more about transfer credits in this
FAQ. Students may not use transfer courses for the biology
minor.
UN3500
Students can get academic credit for working in a lab, by
registering for BIOL UN3500 Independent Research. This
is not to be confused with SURF or the Amgen Scholars
Program, which fulfill the biology major lab requirement
but does not confer academic credit. Generally students
register for 3 or 4 credits. A general rule is 4 hours lab
time/week/credit, i.e. register for 3 credits for 12 hours
of lab time/week and 4 credits from 16 hours of lab time/
week. You will need to find a lab to work in. Please make
it clear to the head of the lab whether you need to work
12 or 16 hours/week. If you are taking this class for a lab
Study Abroad Courses
If you are planning to study abroad, please meet with your
Advisor before you go. You'll need prior approval for any
majors, concentrators, and biology minor courses that you
216Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
requirement, you need to take it for a letter grade. You
will be required to write a research paper at the end of the
semester. (See UN3500 requirements.)
While it's nice to be able to get credit for your lab
experience, keep in mind that this means that you're making
a commitment to work there for the entire semester.
Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
The biology-related majors in the Department of Biological
Sciences do not include a Senior Thesis.
Undergraduate Research Outside of Courses
Please see the Undergraduate Research page on the
department website for advice and information on
undergraduate research.
Department Honors and Prizes
Department Honors
Students must apply for departmental honors. Applications
are due no later than one day before spring break of their
senior year. For details, please visit the departmental
website at https://biology.columbia.edu/content/honors-

Academic Prizes
Bridges and Sturtevant Prize
This prize results from an anonymous donation in 2011
establishing an endowment for the prize. Bridges and
Sturtevant were certainly amazing Columbia undergrads
who were true pioneers of modern genetics. Alfred
Sturtevant is recounted to have taken time off from
studying for classes one weekend to work on understanding
some crosses. The result was his figuring out that genes
were arranged in a row on a chromosome.
The prize description reads: "Columbia shall .... award an
annual prize to be known as the Bridges and Sturtevant
Prize in Biological Sciences in honor of Calvin Bridges and
Alfred Sturtevant. Their pioneering studies as Columbia
College undergraduates - using the fruit fly Drosophila
melanogaster in Thomas Hunt Morgan's laboratory - laid
the basis for our understanding of genes and the way they
behave. Each year the prize will be awarded to one or more
graduating seniors whose experimental or computational
research is deemed to have been both highly original and
fruitful by a committee of faculty to be selected by the
Chair of Biological Sciences."
Faculty members in the Dept. of Biological Sciences can
nominate student(s) for the prize. A committee of faculty
members decide who will receive the award.
It is awarded yearly, just before graduation.
Awarded to a graduating senior whose research has been
deemed highly original and fruitful.
Each student is awarded a monetary prize.

For students majoring in Biochemistry or Neuroscience &
Behavior (joint majors), you should consult advisers in both
departments to plan your program, each regarding their specific
courses (e.g. biology course exceptions will need to be approved
by a biology adviser, chemistry course exceptions will need to
be approved by a chemistry adviser).
Returning students should check the departmental website for
any last-minute changes and/or additional information. See
especially undergraduate updates and list of department courses.
All major and minor requirements are detailed on the website
and links provided below.
Double Majoring/Minoring
The Department of Biological Sciences offers five
undergraduate majors (Biology, Biophysics, Biochemistry,
Computational Biology, and Neuroscience and Behavior),
along with a Biology Minor, across two schools: Columbia
College and General Studies. Students can only choose one
major/minor within the Department. You may not major in
Biology/ Biochemistry/ Biophysics/ Computational Biology/
Neuroscience & Behavior and have a Biology Minor.
You cannot major in:
• Biochemistry & also major / minor in chemistry
• Biophysics & also major / minor in physics
218Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
• Computational biology & also major / minor in computer
science or major/minor in math
• Neuroscience & also major / minor in psychology
Students can only double count two of the following
fundamental courses for both a biology-related major/minor and
any other major / minor they pursue: General Chemistry I & II
or Calc I & II.
Biochemistry (BIOL UN3300 or BIOL GU4501) cannot be
counted for a biology-related major / minor and for any other
major / minor.
Course Numbering Structure
NOTE: Numbering does not reflect difficulty but rather whether
UGs & graduate students have different requirements:
3000 – Only UGs register
4000 – UGs and graduate students perform the same
5000 – Only graduate students register, requires additional
work beyond the 3000 course; 3000 (UGs) & 5000 (Grad.) are
different versions of the same course, i.e. same time, location,
and lectures
Guidance for First-Year Students
Please see the FAQs for First-Year Students.
Guidance for Transfer Students
Please see the FAQs for Transfer Students.
Undergraduate Programs of
Study
Required Coursework for all Programs
All majors and the minor should start with General Chemistry 1
& 2 in their first year at Columbia. This is a required prerequisite
before you may begin the Introductory Biology sequence.
Grade Requirements for the Major
A grade of C- or higher must be earned and revealed on your
transcript for any course – including the first – to be counted
toward the major, minor, or concentration requirements. The
grade of P is not acceptable. A course that was taken Pass/D/
Fail may be counted if and only if the P is uncovered by the
Registrar's deadline.
Please note that a few exceptions are applicable for the
following terms:
• All courses in Spring 2020 were taken with mandatory Pass/
Fail grades.
• Further exceptions are allowed for 2020-2021, when
students can opt to take one course Pass/Fail during the Fall
2020, Spring 2021, and Fall 2021 semesters, without any
restrictions - this can be in a course required for their major
or minor.
• In Spring 2024, students could opt to take two major/minor
courses Pass/Fail.
If you are concerned about a P grade counting for the major,
please consult with your adviser.
COURSES
Non-Major Courses
The following biology-related courses do not count towards the
major or as one of the 4 courses that all biology majors must
take at Columbia University. This list is not exhaustive, and you
should discuss your major courses with your biology adviser.
• BIOL UN1004 Foundations of Biology
• BIOL UN1130 Genes and Development
• BIOL UN1360 Science and Society
• BIOL UN1908 First-year seminar in biology
• BIOL UN2300 Interpreting Scientific Evidence
All biology-related majors: at least 4 biology or biochemistry
courses and at least 18 credits of the total (biology,
biochemistry, math, physics, and chemistry) must be taken
at Columbia. Barnard courses may not be substituted for the
required Columbia courses without advance permission from
the adviser. The two required core courses should be taken at
Columbia. Courses covering the same topics as Bio dept core
courses, but taken elsewhere, are counted as electives, not as
core courses.
Exceptions to Requirements
Students must get written permission in advance for any
exceptions to the requirements listed below. For the exceptions
to be applied toward graduation, the student must get the
exception approved by the faculty adviser, who will then send an
e-mail explaining the exceptions to mes2314@columbia.edu.

Students planning graduate work in biology should keep in mind
that physical chemistry and statistics are important for many
graduate programs.
Repeating Biology CoursesIntroductory Courses
Introductory biology I & II (BIOL UN2005/6 & BIOL
UN2401/2) may only be taken twice, this includes taking two
exams, W, D and F. You may petition to take intro bio I or II a
third time. 3000 & 4000 level biology courses may only be taken
once. You may petition to take the same course a second time.The usual one-year introductory biology
sequence is BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I:
BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC-BIOL UN2006 INTRO BIO II:CELL
BIO,DEV/PHYS, taken in the sophomore year.
Prerequisites
Course prerequisites are strictly enforced. Prerequisites must
be taken before the course, not after or concurrently. Biology
courses taken before the completion of any of its prerequisites,
even with instructor approval, are not counted toward the
major, minor, or interdepartmental majors. Exemptions from a
prerequisite requirement may only be made, in writing, by the
department's director of undergraduate studies. Credits from a
course taken prior to the completion of its prerequisites are not
counted towards the major requirements. As a consequence,
students are required to complete additional, specific courses in
biology at the direction of the director of undergraduate studies.
4+1 Programs
A B- or better in both introductory biology I & II (BIOL
UN2005 & BIOL UN2006) are required to be eligible for any
4+1 programs.
Major in Biology
General Information
The requirements for the biology major include courses in
biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics.
The required biology courses are one year of introductory
biology, two core courses in biology, two 3-point electives
in biology, and an appropriate lab experience. See below for
details.
The required courses outside the biology department are
chemistry through organic (plus labs), one year of college-level
physics (plus lab), and the completion of one year of college-
level mathematics (usually calculus).
Alternative sequences to the above may be arranged in
special circumstances, but only with the permission of a
departmental adviser or the director of undergraduate studies
obtained in advance. For example, selected courses at the
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center are open to advanced
undergraduates with adviser approval. Credit toward the major
for courses not listed in the Columbia College Bulletin must be
discussed in advance with a departmental adviser or the director
of undergraduate studies. Students are responsible for notifying
Other sequences require permission in advance from
a departmental adviser or the director of undergraduate
studies. Students with a strong background in chemistry or
molecular biology may take BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I:
BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC-BIOL UN2006 INTRO BIO II:CELL
BIO,DEV/PHYS in their first year; the permission of one of the
instructors is required.
Premedical students usually take BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I:
BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC-BIOL UN2006 INTRO BIO II:CELL
BIO,DEV/PHYS after a year of general chemistry.
Students with advanced placement in biology are expected to
take BIOL UN2005 INTRO BIO I: BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC
as their initial biology course, because BIOL UN2005 INTRO
BIO I: BIOCHEM,GEN,MOLEC-BIOL UN2006 INTRO BIO
II:CELL BIO,DEV/PHYS is taught at a level of detail and depth
not found in most advanced placement courses.

The Study of ChemistryDr. Vesna Gasperov (vg2231@columbia.edu)
Chemistry, the study of molecules, is a central science
interesting for its own sake but also necessary as an intellectual
link to the other sciences of biology, physics, and environmental
science. Faculty find the various disciplines of chemistry
fascinating because they establish intellectual bridges between
the macroscopic or human-scale world that we see, smell, and
touch, and the microscopic world that affects every aspect of
our lives. The study of chemistry begins on the microscopic
scale and extends to engage a variety of different macroscopic
contexts.Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Advanced Placement
Chemistry is currently making its largest impact on society at
the nexus between chemistry and biology and the nexus between
chemistry and engineering, particularly where new materials are
being developed. A typical chemistry laboratory now has more
computers than test tubes and no longer smells of rotten eggs.
The chemistry department majors are designed to help students
focus on these new developments and to understand the factors
influencing the nature of the discipline. Because the science
is constantly changing, courses change as well, and while
organic and physical chemistry remain the bedrock courses,
they too differ greatly from the same courses 40 years ago.
Many consider biochemistry to be a foundation course as
well. Although different paths within the chemistry major take
different trajectories, there is a core that provides the essential
foundation students need regardless of the path they choose.
Students should consider majoring in chemistry if they share or
can develop a fascination with the explanatory power that comes
with an advanced understanding of the nature and influence of
the microscopic world of molecules.
Students who choose to major in chemistry may elect to
continue graduate study in this field and obtain a Ph.D. which
is a solid basis for a career in research, either in the industry
or in a university. A major in chemistry also provides students
with an astonishing range of career choices such as working
in the chemical or pharmaceutical industries or in many other
businesses where a technical background is highly desirable.
Other options include becoming a financial analyst for a
technical company, a science writer, a high school chemistry
teacher, a patent attorney, an environmental consultant, or a
hospital laboratory manager, among others. The choices are
The department grants advanced placement (AP) credit for a
score of 4 or 5 or the equivalent. The amount of credit granted
is based on the results of the department assessment exam and
completion of the requisite course. Students who register for
CHEM UN1604 (2ND TERM GEN CHEM, INTENSIVE)
are granted 3 points of credit; students who register for
CHEM UN2045 (INTENSIVE ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
I-CHEM UN2046 INTENSIVE ORGANIC CHEM II) are
granted 6 points of credit. In either case, credit is granted only
upon completion of the course with a grade of C or better.
Students must complete a department assessment exam prior to
registering for either of these courses.
Transfer Courses
Students who are transferring to Columbia should contact Dr.
Vesna Gasperov (vg2231@columbia.edu) to have any chemistry
courses assessed for equivalency. Please email a detailed
syllabus and transcript.
Study Abroad Courses
Chemistry department majors who are planning to study abroad
should contact Dr. Vesna Gasperov (vg2231@columbia.edu) if
they wish to study any chemistry abroad.
Undergraduate Research
Undergraduate Research in Courses
Students can get academic credit for undergraduate research
by registering for CHEM UN3098 Supervised Independent
Research. Generally, students register for 4 credits as this will
fulfill one of the requirements of the Chemistry major. You will
be expected to commit the same number of hours to research
as you would for any other 4 credit class, around 12-16 hours
per week throughout the entire semester. You need to obtain
permission from your faculty sponsor and Dr. Gasperov to
register for UN3098. At the end of the semester, you will be
229Chemistry
required to present a poster of your research results at a poster
session for all UN3098 students.
Undergraduate Research Outside of Courses
Students often ask, why should I do research? Research is
exciting! You will design experiments, discover phenomena
and make new molecules that no one has ever seen before.
Furthermore, there are several practical reasons why you should
consider research as an undergraduate student.
Research is a great way to learn more about chemistry. The
concepts you learn in the classroom will come to light when you
do research. You will also learn more about instrumentation,
data analysis, and gain experience in writing reports, preparing
posters, and discussing science with your research group
members.
Research is a great career builder! Whether you are considering
graduate school, professional school, or joining the workforce
after graduation, research as an undergraduate will be an
invaluable experience that will sharpen your critical thinking
and provide you with the unique opportunity to work alongside
world-leading faculty, graduate students and post-doctoral
fellows.
The faculty in the Department of Chemistry carry out
fundamental and applied research at both the core and frontiers
of this scientific discipline. There are many opportunities for
research during the academic year and in the summer with
faculty in the department.
If you are interested in working in a research laboratory, you
should take the following steps:
Investigate faculty research projects by using the department’s
website,
http://chem.columbia.edu/research/, or by speaking directly with
faculty members.
Decide which faculty research project interests you.
Contact that faculty member directly to inquire about research
opportunities within his/her laboratory.
The Program Manager for Undergraduate Studies, Dr. Vesna
Gasperov, can assist you with this process.
Qualified students can take the First Year Seminar in Chemical
Research course (CHEM UN2408) during the Spring semester
in which you will have the opportunity to learn about research
conducted within the chemistry department and other science
departments in the university. This can help to identify areas of
interest that you may not have considered.

Guidance for Undergraduate
Students in the Department
Program Planning for all Students
The Department of Chemistry offers four distinct academic
major programs for undergraduates interested in professional-
level training and education in the chemical sciences: chemistry,
chemical physics, biochemistry and environmental chemistry.
For students interested in a program of less extensive study and
coursework, the department offers a concentration in chemistry.
In the first year, Track 1 students with one year of high school
chemistry take a one-year course in general chemistry, and
the one-term laboratory course that accompanies it. In the
second year, students study organic chemistry, and take organic
chemistry laboratory.
Students who qualify by prior assessment during orientation
week can place into the advanced tracks. There are two options.
Track 2 students take, in the fall term, a special one-term
intensive course in general chemistry in place of the one-year
course. In the second year, students study organic chemistry and
take organic chemistry laboratory. Track 3 students take a one-
year course in organic chemistry for first-year students and the
one-term intensive general chemistry laboratory course. In the
232Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
second year, students may enroll in physical chemistry and the
organic chemistry laboratory course.
The results of the department assessment exam are used to
advise students which track to pursue. The Department of
Chemistry offers three different tracks. Students who wish to
take Track 2 or 3 classes must take the department assessment
exam. Students who wish to pursue Track 1 classes do not need
to take the assessment exam.

The Study of Classics
Classics is the study of the civilizations of ancient Greece and
Rome (c. 900 BCE to 500 CE): their languages, literature,
history, philosophy, art, and ways of life. The Department of
Classics offers a wide variety of courses, geared at students with
different interests and at all levels of preparation. These include
courses on ancient civilization in all its diversity, classes on
ancient literature in translation, and numerous courses in ancient
Greek and Latin, from elementary language classes to advanced
literature courses. We also offer courses on ancient Egypt as
well as the Near East, Medieval Latin, and Modern Greek.
Student Advising
Consulting Advisers
Director of Undergraduate Studies: Professor Nikolas Kakkoufa,
Nk2776@columbia.edu
Students should consult with the DUS who will direct them to
the appropriate faculty advisor for their research interest area.
Enrolling in Classes
Students starting in the Major should start with the language
placement exam to determine the appropriate language level for
their prior knowledge. Exams are administered in late August by
the Department of Classics. Students who cannot take the exam
should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies to make
arrangements.
For those students who are starting the major without prior
knowledge of the ancient languages please start at the beginning
of the sequence (1000 level) in one of the ancient languages and
speak to the Director of Undergraduate Studies to determine
your best course of study.
Preparing for Graduate Study
https://classics.columbia.edu/preparation-for-graduate-study
Students who are considering graduate work in Classics
should be aware that because our Classics major is not a
pre-professional degree, simply fulfilling the normal major
requirements will not guarantee admission to a graduate
program. By far the most important element in preparation
for graduate school admission is a good command of both the
Latin and the Greek languages, so students who wish to go to
graduate school should attempt to reach the advanced level
in both languages. The two courses at the intermediate level
required in the secondary language for the Classics major are
not enough for admission to most graduate programs, and the
language requirements of both Classical Studies and Ancient
Studies are well below the level normally necessary for graduate
school admission. The importance of languages holds not only
for students wishing to study ancient literature, but also for
those interested primarily in other aspects of the ancient world
(history, art, philosophy, religion, etc.), because it is not possible
to pursue advanced research successfully unless one can make
use of the primary sources. Students who have not done the
requisite amount of language work and wish to go to graduate
school can enroll in a post-baccalaureate program (either at
Columbia or at another institution) to do one or two years of
intensive language work before starting graduate school.
While knowledge of Latin and Greek is the most important
factor in graduate school admission, it is by no means the only
one. Students considering graduate work are also advised to
write a senior thesis (and not to substitute the thesis for any
of the other advanced courses). If possible, it is a good idea to
use some of your summers (especially the one between junior
and senior year) on a relevant activity such as archaeological
fieldwork experience, travel and/or study in Greece or Italy,
learning French or German, improving your Latin or Greek, or
working as a research assistant for a Classicist. It is also useful
to get high scores on the GRE test, and these are best achieved
by obtaining and studying information on the types of questions
asked on the test and taking practice tests.
The department does offer a combined BA/MA program in
Classics allowing them to complete the MA in Classics within
one year of receiving their BA.
The array of graduate degrees on offer in the US and abroad
can be bewildering—including master’s and doctoral programs
in Classics and a variety of related subjects—and the character
and quality of graduate programs differs widely. It is therefore
important to gather information and seek advice.
If you are considering graduate work, you should discuss your
plans with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and other
faculty members no later than the beginning of the fall semester
before you hope to apply (i.e., typically the fall of your senior
year).
Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Advanced Placement
The department grants 3 credits for a score of 5 on the Latin AP
exam, which also satisfies the foreign language requirement,
238Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
upon successful completion (with a grade of B or higher) of a
Latin class at the 3000-level or higher.
Barnard College Courses
The Department of Classics at Columbia and the Department
of Classics and Ancient Studies at Barnard College work
closely together. Students may take courses at Barnard to count
towards the Major or Minor. Students at Barnard should speak
to their advisor at Barnard regarding Columbia courses as the
departments are distinct and the requirements for their respective
majors are different.
Transfer Courses
Students transferring to Columbia should contact the Director of
Undergraduate Studies to discuss equivalencies and what level
of courses they wish to take.
Study Abroad Courses
Seeing the ancient sites and monuments is an important part of
the study of antiquity, and there are a number of ways to acquire
some familiarity with the physical remains of Greek and Roman
civilization. The Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in
Rome offers in each term an excellent one-semester program,
usually taken in the junior year, and the College Year in Athens
offers a wide variety of courses ranging from language and
literature to history, art, and archaeology. During the summer
there are more options, including the outstanding Summer
Sessions of the American School for Classical Studies in Athens.
A listing of fieldwork opportunities is published annually by the
Archaeological Institute of America.
Summer Courses
Courses are offered over the summer by the department
providing opportunities to study the ancient languages over the
summer.
Courses are also offered in Classical Civilization including
Worlds of Alexander and Classical Mythology.
Core Curriculum Connections
Faulty and Graduate Instructors from the Department of
Classics Teach in the Core, usually Literature Humanities and
Contemporary Civilization.
Some Classics courses can be used to count toward the Global
Core requirement as noted in the course information.
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Undergraduate Research in Courses
Students should consult with the Director of Undergraduate
Studies, Professor Nikolas Kakkoufa at nk2776@columbia.edu.
Students can register for Directed readings with a faculty

Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
Students are required to take the Major Seminar UN3996 as part
of the program. The course focuses on the preparation for the
Senior Thesis and methods in the field of Classics. Currently
students have the option to participate in a trip abroad to sites in
the ancient world.
Undergraduate Research Outside of Courses
Students are encouraged to participate in the Ancient Play put on
yearly by the Barnard Columbia Ancient Drama Group.
The Department is able to support a limited number of students
to study ancient languages over the summer through the
Comager Fund and the Undergraduate Latin fund. Interested
students should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies.
Undergraduate students can apply to the SNFPHI Summer
Research Internship in Public Humanities and Hellenic Studies.
This six week internship invites undergraduate students to
explore public humanities, gain hands-on experience with
its objectives, methods, and outcomes, and pursue a group
project that connects research on Greece with a broad public
audience. The internship is structured around: (1) a seminar in
Hellenic Studies in which students explore aspects of modern
Greek history and culture relevant to their internship research,
(2) a workshop in which students are trained in the methods
and tools of public-facing research, and (3) a group project in
which students work closely with Columbia faculty and public
humanities partners in Greece.
Columbia runs its own archeological summer program at
Hadrian's Villa in Tivoli. Contact Professor Francesco de
Angelis.
Students wanting Columbia or Barnard credit for work
done abroad should discuss their plans with the director
of undergraduate studies at an early date to enable them to
incorporate experience abroad most practically into their
programs here.
Department Honors and
Prizes
Department Honors
Departmental Honors are awarded for overall outstanding
performance in the Classics.
Academic Prizes
The department offers two prize competitions yearly (Earle and
Romaine) in sight translation of Greek and Latin. These prizes
are awarded on the basis of examinations given each spring.
Two prizes are given to graduating Columbia College seniors:
• The Caverly Prize is awarded annually for outstanding
performance by a graduating Columbia College major.
239Classics
• The Stadler Prize is awarded annually to a graduating senior
of Columbia College who is judged by the faculty to have
demonstrated academic excellence through course work and
the writing of a senior essay on some aspect of the history or
culture of the classical world.
Other Important Information
Students interested in majoring in Classics should reach out
to the Department early in their academic career. Students
should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies with any
questions.

The Study of Modern Greek
The Program offers students the opportunity to study Greece
through a modern lens and prepares them for professional
work or further academic study in the humanities and social
sciences, international studies, fine arts or, more recently, more
interdepartmental endeavors. At the heart of the curriculum
is a series of courses that investigate the relation between
language and culture in the Greek-speaking world (including
the diaspora) throughout its modern history. The aim has been
to build a strong linguistic base on which to construct a greater
knowledge of Modern Greek literary, political, social, and
cultural currents and attitudes, and also to offer students a
theoretical framework for analyzing cultural differences more
generally. Since then, Balkan and Mediterranean Studies, but
also Classical Reception Studies outside the strict Classics
world, have become part of the Hellenic Studies curriculum,
especially insofar as they contribute to Global Core, Global
Humanities, and interdisciplinary initiatives.
The Core Faculty of the PHS are Dimitris Antoniou, Chrysanthe
Filippardos, Stathis Gourgouris, Nikolas P. Kakkoufa, Paraskevi
Martzavou, and Karen Van Dyck. A number of affiliated
faculty (but also the HLS faculty that is housed in Classics –
Gourgouris, Van Dyck, Kakkoufa) teach and conduct their
research in relation with other departments, institutes, and
initiatives – notably, the Institute for Comparative Literature
and Society (ICLS), the Institute for the Study of Sexuality and
Gender (ISSG), the Institute for the Study of Human Rights,
the Harriman Institute, and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation
Public Humanities Initiative (SNFPHI). Its affiliated faculty
members include, among others, John Ma in Classics, Mark
Mazower in History, Ioannis Mylonopoulos in Art History
and Archaeology, Neni Panourgia in the Justice in Education
Program, Elsa Stamatopoulou in Human Rights, Nadia Urbinati
in Political Science, and Konstantina Zanou in Italian.
The PHS organizes and co-sponsors the University Seminar
in Modern Greek, a Lecture Series with the Greek Consulate
in New York and a number of Hellenic Studies Workshops,
Film Screenings, and occasional colloquia that provide a forum
of discussion of research in progress on all aspects of Greek
Civilization of which our students frequently take advantage.
It also maintains a strong collaboration with the Stavros
Niarchos Foundation Public Humanities Initiative and the newly
established Columbia Global Center in Athens.
Student Advising
Consulting Advisers
The Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) of the Program in

path of study but it has prepared students for further study in a
number of disciplines with a focus on Modern Greece.
Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Advanced Placement
The Program in Hellenic Studies offers a language placement
test the week before the first day of classes in the fall. The test
consists of both written and oral parts. Students who wish to
schedule the test before the start of the fall semester, or to take
a Modern Greek placement test at any other time in the year, or
who have particular questions about placing, should contact the
Director of Undergraduate Studies.
Barnard College Courses
The Program in Hellenic Studies offers a Minor in Modern
Greek at Barnard College. The Minor requires five courses
240Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
beyond the Elementary Level. The Minor in Modern Greek
is administered through the Department of Classics and
Ancient Studies at Barnard College. Students wishing to
minor in Modern Greek should consult with the Director of
Undergraduate Studies.
Transfer Courses
Students transferring to Columbia should contact the Director of
Undergraduate Studies to discuss equivalencies and what level
of courses they wish to take.
Study Abroad Courses
Students may wish to enroll in the College Year in Athens
Program for a semester-long or summer session. The College
Year in Athens offers a wide variety of courses ranging from
language and literature to history, art, and archaeology. Students
wanting credit for work done abroad should discuss their plans
with the Director of Undergraduate Studies at an early date to
enable them to incorporate experience abroad most practically
into their programs here.
Summer Courses
Students can enroll in the Travel Seminar, “Mediterranean
Humanities in Athens”, organized in partnership with Columbia
Global, the Aikaterini Laskaridis Foundation, and the Center for
Undergraduate Global Engagement. Students participating in
this seminar take Athens, Greece, as a vantage point to explore
the multiple ways this body of water has been imagined by the
people who lived or traveled across its shores. In this one-week
seminar, students immerse themselves in the history and culture
of Athens and its environs through a combination of lectures,
guided museum visits, educational walks, field trips, and hands-
on workshops.

Guidance for Undergraduate
Students in Classics
Program Planning for all Students
The department offers a major in classics and a major track in
classical studies. The major in classics involves the intensive
study of both Greek and Latin, as well as their cultural matrix;
the track in classical studies offers a more interdisciplinary
approach. The major in classics is recommended for students
planning to continue the study of classics in graduate school.
The department also participates in the interdepartmental ancient
studies program and offers a concentration in classics; these are
all described below.
The major in classics and the track in classical studies are
designed in part to build on the experience of the ancient world
that undergraduates have acquired at Columbia in the Core
Curriculum (especially in Literature Humanities). The major
in classics is structured on the principle of gradual and closely
monitored linguistic progress from the elementary (1100-level)
to the advanced (3000- and 4000-levels) and ultimately to the
literature survey courses (GU4105-GU4106) in Greek and/or
Latin.
Those majors intending to embark on graduate study in classics
are especially encouraged to undertake, in their senior year, an
independent research project (UN3998). This option is designed
to allow students to personalize their experience in the major
by conducting advanced study in a specialized area under the
guidance of the specializing faculty member of their choice.
UN3998 is required in the classical studies track. Otherwise,
students in classical studies are not required to take advanced
courses beyond UN3996 The Major Seminar, but are expected to
follow a coherent plan of study by taking a sequence of cognate
courses in different but related departments (e.g., art history and
archaeology, history, etc.).
Course Numbering Structure
In both Greek and Latin prerequisites are the course with the
number before in the sequence. Students can test out of the
1102: Elementary II
1121: Intensive Elementary
2101: Intermediate I
2102: Intermediate II
For 2101 Either 1102 or 1121 is required as a prerequisite or a
placement test.
The course numbers below are used for both Greek and Latin,
except as noted. Please consult the Columbia and Barnard
catalogs for full descriptions of all courses.
1101-2: Introductory language course in TWO semesters. This
is the normal course taken by those beginning a language not
previously studied; it covers all the basic grammar and gives
some practice reading easy texts.
1121: This one-semester course is the equivalent of both 1101
and 1102; it covers all the basic grammar in one semester and
enables the participants to take courses at the 2100 level the
following semester. This is an intensive course, so you should be
prepared to make a substantial time commitment.
2101-2: This sequence provides intermediate language training
in both prose and poetry. The completion of 2102 satisfies the
language requirement.
3012 (Latin only): This is the fifth-semester Latin course and
the beginning of the Latin literature sequence. It is highly
recommended for incoming first-year students who have had
enough Latin to place out of 2101-2 or for those who have
completed the intermediate sequence here.
3013 (Latin only): This new course is designed as a sequel or
alternative to 3012 and aims to sharpen translation skills by
concentrating on classical Latin prose.
3309, 3310, 4009, 4010: These advanced literature courses
are offered annually with changes in subject matter so that
students will have a chance to read as many representative
authors as possible. Courses at the 4000 level are not necessarily
more difficult than those at the 3000 level when taken by
undergraduates; the significance of the designation is that
graduate students as well as undergraduates may take 4000 level
courses, but in many cases undergraduates and graduates will
not be given the same workload in these courses. Students who
are in doubt about the level of a specific class should consult the
instructor.
3033, 4152 (Latin only): These courses constitute the sequence
in medieval Latin; in most years both will be offered.
242Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
3996: The Major Seminar is intended for senior majors in
Classics, Classical Studies, and Ancient Studies but is also open
to juniors. The course considers a different topic each year,
analyzing it across time periods, genres, and both languages.
It focuses on honing skills that are useful for working on the
senior thesis, such as how to frame a discussion topic, how
to analyze a text philologically and thematically, and how to
develop a bibliography. The course also provides upper-level
students in Classics, Classical Studies, and Ancient Studies with
an opportunity to get to know each other in a congenial and
interactive environment.
4105-6: The literature surveys are designed to give advanced
Classics undergraduates and entering graduate students a grasp
of the broader picture of Greek or Latin literature, as opposed to
the more focused topics offered in other advanced courses.
5139: This course focuses on enabling students to write, as
well as read, Greek and Latin. It consists largely of an intensive
review of grammar and syntax at an advanced level, with the
translation of sentences or short paragraphs into the ancient
languages. Note: This is technically a graduate course, but
undergraduates are welcome to enroll with the instructor’s
permission. 5139 replaces the old 4139; the content of the course
remains the same.
CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION AND LITERATURE IN
TRANSLATION
These courses are designed for both majors and non-majors and
are ideal for students with no prior background in the ancient
world, though they may also be of interest to more advanced
students. Some, such as Classical Myth (3132), are normally
offered every year; others are offered in rotation or once only.
Guidance for First-Year Students
The director of undergraduate studies is responsible for
overseeing the path of study followed by each student in classics
or classical studies. Through close interaction with the director
of undergraduate studies, as well as with other faculty members
where appropriate, each major is strongly encouraged to debate
the strengths and weaknesses of his or her own trajectory
of study even as the requirements for the major are being
completed.
Students should contact the director of undergraduate studies
with any questions about the classics majors and course
offerings. The director of undergraduate studies can provide
students with a worksheet to help in planning their progress
toward major requirements.
Guidance for Transfer Students
Students should contact the director of undergraduate studies
with any questions about the classics majors and course
offerings. The director of undergraduate studies can provide
students with a worksheet to help in planning their progress
toward major requirements.
Undergraduate Programs of
Study: Classics
Required Coursework for all Programs
The major is offered with two tracks, Classics and Classical
Studies. The former, which is recommended for students
considering graduate work in Classics, concentrates heavily on
the ancient languages and literature; the latter can be earned with
only one of the ancient languages and includes more courses
on other aspects of the ancient world. The Classics department
also participates in the interdepartmental Ancient Studies major,
which is designed for students whose interests encompass the
ancient Mediterranean as a whole rather than the Greco-Roman
world in particular. The Classics Concentration/Minor is earned
in either Latin or Greek; there is also a Greek/Latin Minor for
students of the School of Engineering and Applied Science.
Major in Classics
11 courses, minimum 34 credits

Major in Ancient Studies
Students interested in a major in ancient studies should see
the Ancient Studies section in this Bulletin.
The Minors in the Department of Classics
There are five tracks towards obtaining a Minor in Classics.
• The track in Classics is designed for students who wish to
study both Greek and Latin language, literature, and culture.
This track envisages advanced competence in one ancient
language and elementary knowledge of the other.
• The tracks in Greek or Latin allow students to develop
significant knowledge of the language, literature, and culture of
either ancient Greece or Rome. These tracks envisage advanced
competence in one ancient language, Greek or Latin, and
sustained study of one ancient civilization.
• The track in Classical and Ancient Civilizations allows
students to receive recognition for coursework in the study of
ancient societies while not mandating the study of an ancient
language. Language work, however, is encouraged and, at and
above the intermediate level, may be counted toward this track.
• The track in Classical Reception and the Classical Tradition
allows students to focus on the cultural legacy of ancient Greek
and Roman societies. Although not required, language work is
encouraged and, at and above the intermediate level, may be
counted toward this track.
Minor tracks in detail
I. CLASSICS. 5 courses. A minimum of 15 credits. (Students
without prior knowledge of Greek and Latin may be required to
take as many as 22 credits in the primary language (elementary
1102 & 1102, intermediate 2101 & 2102, and advanced 3009
& 3010), 8 credits in the secondary language (elementary 1101
& 1102), and 6 credits for the Cultural and Historical Breadth
requirement.)
• Primary Language: Three courses in the primary language at
or above the 2100-level.
• Secondary Language: One course in the secondary language
at or above the 1102-level.
• Cultural and Historical Breadth: One course on any aspect
of any aspect of the culture (including archaeology, art history,
history, literature, philosophy, and post-Classical reception) of
the primary language.
II & III. GREEK OR LATIN A minimum of 15 credits.
(Students without knowledge of Greek or Latin may be required
to take as many as 19 credits in one language (elementary 1102
& 1102, intermediate 2101 & 2102, and advanced 3009), as well
as 6 credits for the Cultural and Historical Concentration.
• Language Concentration: Three courses in Greek or Latin
at or above the 2100-level; The minor—Greek or Latin—is
determined by the language chosen for the Language Core.
• Cultural and Historical Concentration: Two courses
on any aspect of any aspect of the literature, culture, and/or
history (including archaeology, art history, history, literature,
philosophy, and post-Classical reception) of the student’s chosen
language. Language courses at or above the 3000-level may
count toward this requirement; it is thus possible for students to
begin studying an ancient language at the elementary level in the
freshman year and to complete the requirements for the minor by
the senior year by taking coursework in that language.
IV. CLASSICAL AND ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS A
minimum of 15 credit points. (Language study is not required
for this track. However, for students who wish to use language
courses to count toward minor requirements, this track may take
more coursework and credit points; how many will depend on
the student’s familiarity with the language.)
• Fundamental Breadth: Five courses on any aspect of the
ancient Greco-Roman Mediterranean and neighboring societies.
• Advanced Studies: Three of the five courses above must be
taken at the advanced (usually UN3000 or above) level. One
Greek or Latin course at or above the 2102-level may count
toward the Advanced Studies requirement.
V. CLASSICAL RECEPTION AND THE CLASSICAL
TRADITION. A minimum of 15 credit points. (Language study
is not required for this track. However, for students who wish to
use language courses to count toward minor requirements, this
track may take more coursework and credit points; how many
will depend on the student’s familiarity with the language.)
• Foundational Breadth 1— Ancient Civilizations:
Two courses on any aspect of the ancient Greco-Roman
Mediterranean and neighboring societies.
• Foundational Breadth 2—Classical Reception and the
Classical Tradition: Three courses on classical reception, the
classical tradition, and/or comparative approaches to the study
of the ancient world. Coursework for this requirement may focus
on Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Hellenic Studies, English,
Comparative Literature, and related disciplines.
• Advanced Studies: Three of the five courses taken for this
minor must be taken at the advanced level (UN3000 or above).
One Greek or Latin course at or above the 2102 level may count
toward the Advanced Studies requirement.
• No fewer than four courses counted toward this track must be
taught by Columbia and Barnard Classics and Ancient Studies
faculty.

Undergraduate Programs of
Study
Minor in Modern Greek Language, Literature,
and Culture
The Minor in Modern Greek Language, Literature, and
Culture (MGLLC) consists of 5 (15-18 credits) courses on
top of the successful completion of the Elementary Modern
Greek Sequence (8 credits). Students may double count the
Intermediate Sequence both for the Language Requirement
and for the MGLLC. The focus of the minor is the study of the
245Classics
language, literature, and Culture of Modern Greece. The minor
is open to Columbia College and General Studies students.• Three additional courses at the 2000 level or above from
at least two of the following three categories:
The general learning goals of this minor are 1) to provide the
training necessary to speak, comprehend, read and write Modern
Greek, which would allow students to participate not only
in basic everyday communications but also to academically
interact with primary material in Modern Greek, 2) to offer
an awareness of the diverse populations and cultures in which
Modern Greek is spoken (Greece, Cyprus, the Diasporas) and
of the sociolinguistic aspect of their language/dialects; a deeper
understanding of what language is and does, 3) to function as
an introduction to the professional abilities and skills needed
to undertake graduate training as scholars in the humanities,
translators, and interpreters, 4) to develop proficiency in the
literary and cultural accomplishments of Modern Greek, 5) to
acquire and hone skills in the methodologies of close reading
of texts and critical thinking, 6) to engage in diverse methods
of inquiry about texts, visual material, and cultural material
more broadly, 7) to raise Global awareness and respect for
other cultures, and 8) to develop abilities in articulation of ideas
and precision in oral/written presentation. These goals are also
enriched by the specific learning goals and methods that our
faculty set in their individual syllabi.• Any course listed by the Program in Hellenic Studies
(GRKM, CLGM, CSGM).
• PREREQUISITE
• Students should have satisfied the Elementary Sequence
(GRKM1101, GRKM1102) or demonstrated equal
proficiency through a placement test administered by the
Program in Hellenic Studies
• DECLARING
• There is no formal application to the Minor. Interested
students should contact the Program’s Director of
Undergraduate Studies, Prof. Nikolas P. Kakkoufa.
• REQUIREMENTS
• Five (15-18 credits) courses on top of the successful
completion of the Elementary Modern Greek Sequence
(8 credits). Any appropriate course taught in the area of
Modern Greek Studies in departments other than Classics
must be approved by the DUS. Typically, no more than
two courses will be allowed to double-count with a
student’s major or the college’s Core Requirements.
• GRKM 2101 Intermediate Modern Greek I
• GRKM 2102 Intermediate Modern Greek II
• Students who place out of the Intermediate Sequence
will have to replace those two courses with the lectures
and seminars offered and cross listed by the Program in
Hellenic Studies. Students are also strongly encouraged
but not required to complete GRKM 3003 prior to
enrolling in other classes.
• Any course cross-listed by the Program in Hellenic
Studies with the code GM (courses that contribute to
an understanding of some aspect of Modern Greece
within larger analytical concepts).
• Directed Readings and Independent Study.
• Though a Senior Thesis is not required for graduation
it enables a student to be considered for departmental
honors. It is advisable to begin planning for the thesis
during the junior year. Interested students should identify
a potential faculty advisor and discuss their plans with the
DUS.
Minor in Hellenic Studies
The Minor in Hellenic Studies consists of 5 courses (15-20
credits). Although there are no prerequisites, the study of either
ancient or modern Greek is highly recommended. To ensure
this truly interdisciplinary course of study the required classes
are based on selecting classes from the following – broadly
conceived – distribution requirements: 1) Period, 2) Discipline,
3) Geography.
The general learning goals of the Minor in Hellenic Studies
are: 1) to introduce students to Hellenic studies as a diverse
and interdisciplinary field and to interdisciplinary research at
Columbia more broadly; 2) to familiarize students not only with
Greece as a space at the crossroads of East and West but also
with the ways in which different disciplines have considered
space across geography and time; 3) to acquire a global
perspective on the reception of Hellenic material and to give
students vital tools needed to engage in diverse methods of
inquiry about texts, visual material, and cultural material more
broadly; 4) to offer students first-hand exposure to objects of
material and visual culture through the Hellenic Collection in
our Library (which has, for example, the biggest collection of
zines outside of Greece) but also the Museums with Hellenic
Collections across the city of New York and, hopefully, with the
further development of the Global Center in Athens, to research
collections and archaeological and historical sites in Greece
with study abroad classes; 5) to critically think about and
problematize the narratives of nations, traditions, and claims to
continuity as it affects today’s world through a deep historical
and broad geographical study 5) to acquire and hone skills
in close reading of texts and critical thinking and to develop
abilities in articulation of complex ideas and precision in
oral/written presentation. It also aims to enrich the students’
undergraduate experience by encouraging them to take part
in the diverse activities and programming of the Program
in Hellenic Studies and the Stavros Niarchos Initiative for Public
246Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Humanities. The minor is open to Columbia College and general
Studies students.
• PREREQUISITE
• There are no prerequisites for the Hellenic Studies Minor.
The study of either ancient or modern Greek is strongly
encouraged.
• DECLARING
• There is no formal application to the Minor. Interested
students should contact the Program’s Director of
Undergraduate Studies, Dr. Nikolas P. Kakkoufa.
• REQUIREMENTS
• 5 courses (15-20 credits) at the 2000 level or above from
at least two of the following three categories:
• Any course listed by the Program in Hellenic Studies
(GRKM, CLGM, CSGM).
• Any course cross-listed by the Program in Hellenic
Studies with the code HLNS (courses that contribute
to an understanding of some aspect of Hellenic studies
in different periods, different disciplinary focus,
different geographical contexts).
• Directed Readings and Independent Study
• Students will need to complete courses in all three
distribution areas: 1) Periods (e.g. Ancient, etc.), 2)
Disciplines (Comparative Literature, Queer Studies,
Anthropology, Translation, History, Archaeology, etc.) 3)
Geography (Mediterranean Studies, etc.) .
For students who entered
Columbia in or before the
2023-24 academic year
Special Concentration in Modern Greek
The minimum credit requirement for the Hellenic Studies
Concentration is 21 credits and includes:
1. Modern Greek language and culture courses (Elementary,
Intermediate, Advanced, Cultural Dictionary I & II, Readings in
Modern Greek; minimum 8 credits). Students will work with the
undergraduate advisor to determine their level of the language.
2. Modern Greek Studies interdepartmental courses (CLGM,
CSGM, HSGM; minimum 12 credits). The program of study
should be planned as early as possible with the Director of
Undergraduate Studies. Students meet with the Director of
Undergraduate Studies each semester in order to obtain program
approval. Opportunities exist for study abroad in Greece, Cyprus
and Turkey for the summer or an academic term for credit.
Students work closely with the concentration advisor on the
selection of the foreign schools and the transfer of credit.
Students may also wish to write a Senior Thesis which will
substitute one Modern Greek Studies interdepartmental seminar.
While not required for graduation, the thesis enables a student
to be considered for departmental honors. It is advisable to
begin planning for the thesis during the student’s junior year.
Interested students should identify a potential faculty advisor.
• Any appropriate course taught in the area of Hellenic
Studies in departments other than Classics, must be

Cognitive Science is the cross-disciplinary study of how the
mind works, with a focus on perception, reasoning, memory,
attention, language, decision-making, motor control, and
problem solving. Cognitive scientists often compare minds
to computers. In particular, they describe mental processes
as computational operations on internal representations. For
instance, perception is seen as a representation of the external
world that results from sensory stimulation; learning is analyzed
as the addition of new representations through interactions with
the environment; reasoning is treated as the addition of new
representations through operations on existing representations.
Cognitive Science is an interdisciplinary field: it draws on
tools and ideas from psychology, neuroscience, linguistics,
economics, computer science, and philosophy, with affiliated
faculty in each of these disciplines. Psychologists study the
computational operations that we use to solve specific tasks;
neuroscientists study the implementation of those operations
in the brain; linguists study the representations involved in
communication; economists study the representations involved
in decisions involving uncertainty and reward; computer
scientists consider how the processes involved in human
cognition fit into a more general theory of computations and
a larger space of tasks; and philosophers ask fundamental
questions about the nature of representation and computation.
Student Learning Outcomes
Cognitive Science majors will gain fluency in computational
methods; a capacity for rigorous and careful thought; a
broad understanding of the affiliated disciplines; and a deep
understanding of cognition.

Cognitive science is the cross-disciplinary study of how the
mind works, with a focus on perception, reasoning, memory,
attention, language, decision-making, motor control, and
problem solving. It draws on tools and ideas from psychology,
neuroscience, linguistics, economics, computer science, and
philosophy. The major requirements are designed to provide
breadth in the affiliated disciplines and depth in the student’s
chosen area of specialization.
A major in Cognitive Science consists of seven required courses
and four electives in a chosen area of specialization culminating
in the senior capstone. The minimum number of courses is 13
and the minimum number of points is 39.
Major Requirements:
1. Required courses (7 classes)
• COGS UN1001 Introduction to Cognitive Science
Introduction to Cognitive Science
• One cognition-focused course in each of four areas:
psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and linguistics.
248Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Courses must be chosen from the approved list in each area;
please see the approved lists below.
• Two courses in a fifth area: mathematical and computational
methods.
Courses must be chosen from the approved list and not be
redundant; please see the approved lists below.
2. Area of Specialization and Electives (four
classes)
Students must choose an area of specialization and four electives
to build expertise in that area.
• Sample specializations: aesthetics, cognitive development,
cognitive linguistics, cognitive neuroscience, cognitive
psychology, consciousness, decision science, human-
computer interaction, intelligence, learning, memory, natural
language processing, neuroeconomics, perception, and social
cognition. Please see below for lists of possible electives for
these specializations.
• The choice of specialization is flexible; the sample
specializations are just examples. This is an opportunity for
students to be creative; a student who has ideas about a new
specialization that they would like to pursue may do so with
the approval of the program director.
• There must be at least one faculty member affiliated with the
program who has expertise in the student’s chosen area so
that they can ensure that the student’s electives will provide
sufficient preparation for the senior project.
the student’s area of specialization. Both courses should be at
the 3000-level or above.
The area of specialization, electives, and capstone must form
a coherent course of study and must be approved by the
program director.
Please note:
• Courses taken pass/fail may not count towards Cognitive
Science major requirements.
• While some courses listed under the sample specializations
are also on the lists of courses approved to count for area
requirements, no course may be double counted: if a student
is counting a course for an area requirement, then that course
may not be counted as an elective.

3. Senior CapstonePSYC UN2210
Students may fulfill the Senior Capstone requirement in
two ways: with a year-long senior project, or by taking two
additional advanced courses.PSYC UN2220
• The senior project is a year-long project in a student’s area
of specialization under the supervision of a chosen advisor.
The project could be an experiment or a paper. Please note
that a student who wishes to do a senior project is responsible
for finding an advisor for the project, though the program
director may be able to suggest faculty members whom the
student might contact.
• Students who do senior projects must register for
both COGS UN3903 Senior Project (3 points) and
COGS UN3901 Senior Project Seminar (1 point) in the
fall and COGS UN3904 Senior Project (3 points) and
COGS UN3902 Senior Project Seminar (1 point) in the
spring (8 points total).
• The Senior Project Seminar is an opportunity for students
to present their projects to each other.
• While a year-long project is recommended, students may
also satisfy the senior capstone requirement by taking two
advanced courses, at least one of which must include a
significant paper or project. The courses must be chosen in
consultation with the program director and must be related to

Offerings
Occasionally, and for a variety of reasons, faculty offer
courses outside of the existing structure of Arts and Sciences
academic departments. Such courses may be colloquia: team-
taught interdisciplinary courses; interdepartmental seminars
explicitly offered by two or more academic departments; or
undergraduate-specific courses offered by faculty outside of
the Arts and Sciences. All of these courses may be counted
toward the undergraduate degree, but it is for the faculty of each
department or program to determine whether or not they can
count toward a major or concentration.

Comparative Literature
and Society and Medical
Humanities majors
The major in Comparative Literature and Society (CLS) allows
qualified students to study literature, culture, and society with
reference to material from several national traditions, or in
combination of literary study with comparative study in other
disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. The program is
designed for students whose interest and expertise in languages
other than English permit them to work comparatively in several
national or regional cultures. The course of study differs from
that of traditional comparative literature programs, both in its
cross-disciplinary nature and in its expanded geographic range,
including not just European, but also Asian, Middle Eastern,
African, and Latin American cultures. Students will thus explore
a variety of methodological and disciplinary approaches to
cultural and literary artifacts in the broadest sense. The cross-
disciplinary range of the program includes visual and media
studies; the law and the humanities; and studies of space, cities,
and architecture.
ICLS also offers a major in Medical Humanities (MedHum). At
the level of the individual patient, medicine and medical systems
diagnose and treat disease to prolong life and to diminish the
suffering that accompanies illness. But in many societies, the
reach of modern biomedicine far exceeds the intimate zone
of patient and caregiver encompassed by this model. From
climate change and food activism to city planning and public
housing, from family planning and surrogacy to gendered
and racial identities, the biomedical model of health now
underwrites national and supra-state policies, corporate ventures,
targets of social and political activism and modes of individual
engagement. Students enrolled in the Medical Humanities major
Undergraduate Administrator: Tomi Haxhi,
th2666@columbia.edu
Consulting Advisers
Students intending to seek admission to the Comparative
Literature and Society major are encouraged to speak as
soon as possible to the Director of Undergraduate Studies
(DUS), Tadas Bugnevicius (tb3111@columbia.edu). Students
intending to seek admission to the Medical Humanities major
are encouraged to speak as soon as possible to the Director of
Medical Humanities, Rishi Goyal, (rkg6@cumc.columbia.edu)
and the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Tadas Bugnevicius
(tb3111@columbia.edu).
Students enroll in either major at the beginning of the spring
semester of the sophomore year by completing the admissions
form that can be found on our website and submitting the
completed form along with a transcript and one-page statement
of academic interests.
In the fall semester, students are invited to attend a Meet-n-
Greet, an informal discussion with current and prospective
majors, our DUS and our Director of Medical Humanities.
Enrolling in Classes
The ICLS majors require that you take the Intro course (CPLS
V3900) in the spring semester of your sophomore year, and
the Senior Seminar (CPLS V3991) in the fall semester of your
senior year. Enrollment in the Intro course requires that you have
already applied to the major or concentration. When it comes
time to register, add the course to your waitlist and you will be
admitted by a member of the ICLS team.
Preparing for Graduate Study
CLS majors often apply to PhD programs and occasionally to
MA programs in Humanities and Social Sciences. All students
should meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Tadas
Bugnevicius, to discuss their plans for graduate studies as early
as they can.
Medical Humanities majors often pursue graduate studies.
Students apply to medical school, master's programs in public
health and PhD programs in the Sciences, Humanities and
254Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Social Sciences. Premedical students should meet with their
pre-medical advisor. All students should meet with the Director
of Medical Humanities, Rishi Goyal, to discuss their plans for
graduate studies as early as they can.
Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Coursework in fulfillment of a major or minor must be taken
at Columbia University unless explicitly noted here and/or
expressly permitted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies
of the program. Exceptions or substitutions permitted by the
Director of Undergraduate Studies should be confirmed in
writing by email to the student.
Advanced Placement
ICLS does not accept any advanced placement credit toward
courses in our curriculum.
Barnard College Courses
Barnard courses 3000-level and above are considered for
this major with the exception of the Barnard Introduction to
Comparative Literature. That course cannot be substituted
for our required Introduction to Comparative Literature and
Society. Students should consult with the DUS on their course
schedule to ensure the courses they choose will meet their course
requirements.
Transfer Courses
When students transfer to Columbia from other institutions, their
coursework at their previous institution must first be considered
by their school in order to be evaluated for degree credit (e.g.,
to confirm that the courses will count toward the 124 points of
credit that every student is required to complete for the B.A.
degree). Only after that degree credit is confirmed, departments
may consider whether those courses can also be used to fulfill
specific degree requirements toward a major at ICLS.
Study Abroad Courses
Classes taken abroad through Columbia-led programs (i.e.,
those administered by Columbia’s Center for Undergraduate
Global Engagement and taught by Columbia instructors) are
treated as Columbia courses, equivalent to those taken on the
Morningside Heights campus. If they are not explicitly listed
by ICLS as fulfilling requirements in the major, the DUS will
need to confirm that they can be used toward requirements in the
major.
Classes taken abroad through other institutions and programs are
treated as transfer credit to Columbia and are subject to the same
policies as other transfer courses. There will be a limit on the
number of courses taken abroad that can be applied to the major,
and they must be approved by the DUS.
Summer Courses
Summer courses at Columbia are offered through the School
of Professional Studies. Courses taken in a Summer Term may
be used toward requirements for the major only as articulated
in department/institute/center guidelines or by permission of
the Director(s) of Undergraduate Studies. More general policies
about summer coursework can be found in the Academic
Regulations section of this Bulletin.
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Undergraduate Research in Courses
The ICLS majors teach students critical theory and
interdisciplinary thinking that are applicable to many areas of
knowledge. The required Intro course (CPLS V3900) introduces
students to theoretical and interdisciplinary methods. The
required Senior Seminar (CPLS V3991) introduces students
to contemporary theoretical debates and is based on current
research interests of ICLS faculty. Students are also given an
opportunity to develop an independent research project. The
optional Senior Thesis workshop (CPLS 3995) is fully dedicated
to advanced independent research.
Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
The senior thesis is optional. If you want to be considered for
departmental honors, it is required. It is a piece of scholarly
research, the model for which is an academic journal article.
A translation or a piece of creative work, such as a piece of
creative writing, can be submitted with the prior approval of the
DUS, and must be accompanied by an explanatory introduction
or foreword of no less than 5000 words in length.
Students interested in writing a senior thesis will submit a thesis
proposal in the spring semester of their junior year. Students
who decide to write a thesis will enroll in a year-long course
(CPLS3995) starting in the fall of their senior year. Detailed
information can be found on our website.
Department Honors and
Prizes
Department Honors
To be eligible for departmental honors students must have a
minimum grade point average of 3.6 for courses in the major.
Departmental honors will be conferred only on students who
have submitted a superior senior thesis that clearly demonstrates
originality and excellent scholarship. Please note that the senior
thesis is not required for the major. Please keep in mind that,
according to Columbia College rules, no more than 10% of the
majors graduating in a department or program in a given year
may be awarded Departmental Honors.

ENGI E1006 Introduction to Computing for Engineers and
Applied Scientists is a general introduction to computing for
STEM students. ENGI E1006 is in fact a required course for
263Computer Science
all engineering students. COMS W1002 Computing in Context
is a course primarily intended for humanities majors, but it also
serves as a pre-introductory course for CS majors. ENGI E1006
and COMS W1002 do not count towards Computer Science
major.
Guidance for Transfer Students
Up to four transfer courses are accepted toward the major.
Up to two transfer courses are accepted toward the minor or
concentration. Calculus, linear algebra, and probability/statistics
courses can be transferred in addition to the four/two-course
limits.

The Creative Writing Program in The School of the Arts
combines intensive writing workshops with seminars that
study literature from a writer's perspective. Students develop
and hone their literary technique in workshops. The seminars
(which explore literary technique and history) broaden
their sense of possibility by exposing them to various ways
that language has been used to make art. Related courses
are drawn from departments such as English, comparative
literature and society, philosophy, history, and anthropology,
among others.
Students consult with faculty advisers to determine the
related courses that best inform their creative work. For
details on the major, see the Creative Writing website: http://

Major in Creative Writing
The major in creative writing requires a minimum of 36 points:
five workshops, four seminars, and three related courses.
Workshop Curriculum (15 points)
Students in the workshops produce original works of fiction,
poetry, or nonfiction, and submit them to their classmates and
instructor for a close critical analysis. Workshop critiques
(which include detailed written reports and thorough line-
edits) assess the mechanics and merits of the writing pieces.
Individual instructor conferences distill the critiques into a direct
plan of action to improve the work. Student writers develop by
practicing the craft under the diligent critical attention of their
peers and instructor, which guides them toward new levels of
creative endeavor.
Creative writing majors select 15 points within the division in
the following courses. One workshop must be in a genre other
than the primary focus. For instance, a fiction writer might take
four fiction workshops and one poetry workshop.

Seminar Curriculum (12 points)
The creative writing seminars form the intellectual ballast of
our program. Our seminars offer a close examination of literary
techniques such as plot, point of view, tone, and voice. They
seek to inform and inspire students by exposing them to a wide
variety of approaches in their chosen genre. Our curriculum, via
these seminars, actively responds not only to historical literary
concerns, but to contemporary ones as well. Extensive readings
are required, along with short critical papers and/or creative
exercises. By closely analyzing diverse works of literature
and participating in roundtable discussions, writers build the
resources necessary to produce their own accomplished creative
work.
Creative writing majors select 12 points within the division.
Any 4 seminars will fulfill the requirement, no matter the
student's chosen genre concentration. Below is a sampling of
our seminars. The list of seminars currently being offered can
be found in the "Courses" section.
These seminars offer close examination of literary techniques
such as plot, point of view, tone, suspense, and narrative
voice. Extensive readings are required, along with creative
exercises.

The Department of Dance
Mission
The Barnard College Department of Dance, located in a world
dance capital, offers an interdisciplinary program that integrates
the study of dance within a liberal arts setting of intellectual and
creative exploration. The major builds upon studio courses, the
Department's productions at Miller Theater, New York Live
Arts, and other venues, as well as a rich array of dance studies
courses, allowing students' creative work to develop in dialogue
with critical inquiry into the history, culture, theory and forms
of western and non-western performance, typically enhanced
by study in other disciplines. Students work with accomplished
artists whose work enriches contemporary American dance; they
also study with outstanding research scholars.
Making, thinking about, and writing about art are an essential
part of the liberal arts education. For this reason, the Department
of Dance offers technique courses for students of all levels of
expertise, while opening its other courses to majors and non-
majors alike, who may also audition for its productions. The
Department partners with cultural institutions in New York City
to connect students with the professional world.
Student Learning Outcomes
Students graduating with a major in Dance should be able to
attain the following outcomes:
• Apply critical thinking, reading, and writing skills to dance-
related texts and choreography.

Transfer Credit
• When students wish to transfer credit to Barnard from other
institutions, their coursework is first evaluated for college
elective credit by the Registrar’s Office. If they are approved,
departments can consider these courses for credit toward the
major or minor.
• Transfer students should send their transcripts to the Dance
Department Chair for credit evaluation.
Study Abroad Credit
• Classes taken abroad through Columbia-led programs
(i.e., those administered by Columbia's Center for Global
Engagement) are treated as Columbia courses, equivalent to
those taken on the Morningside Heights campus.
• Classes taken abroad through other institutions or programs
are treated as transfer credit and are subject to the same
policies as other transfer courses. Accordingly, there will be
a limit on the number of study abroad courses taken at other
institutions that can be counted toward the major or minor.
• To receive credit toward the major or minor for a study
abroad course (whether taken through a Columbia program
or another institution/program), students must submit a Study
Abroad Approval form through Slate and obtain the approval
of the Chair or departmental representative.
Summer Credit
• Summer courses at Barnard are equivalent to those taken
during the academic year. Courses that have been approved
for the fulfillment of departmental requirements will
automatically count toward your major.
• Courses taken at other institutions (including Columbia)
are considered transfer credit and are subject to the same
governing other transfer courses. To receive major or minor
credit for a summer course taken at another institution,
students must submit a Summer Course form through Slate
and have it approved by both the Registrar's Office and the

Senior Seminar (DNCE BC3591) is the capstone experience
of your years of study as a dance major. It is probably the most
challenging course you will take in the Department, because
for so much of the time you will be working on your own, and
because the thesis is probably the longest and most complex
piece of analytical writing that you will undertake in college. No
matter what your area of interest, you need to come up with a
topic, create a bibliography, develop an original thesis, conduct
in-depth research, and build a convincing argument in support of
your claims. This is not a project that you can do overnight. By
the same token, it is one that will stand you in good stead even
if you never write another word about your topic. The process of
conceptualizing, researching, writing, and revising a thesis – and
the skills all this entails – will carry over into realms of activity
very far from dance.
Senior Project: Repertory for Dance (DNCE BC 3593) is
the culminating experience of your major work and is based
on research, investigation, interpretation, and the creative
synthesis of movement. As with Senior Seminar, there will be
a good amount of time in which you are working on your own,
whether it is creating the movement language and managing
your rehearsal schedule (including studio space requests to
the Technical Director), attending to the music-sound needs
of your work with the Music Director, exploring multi-media
possibilities, or creating/recreating/staging choreography or
designing/resourcing costumes for your work. Students will
work on their own creative project as well as offering support for
each other’s work throughout the semester.

The Study of Theatre
The undergraduate theatre major is housed in the Barnard
College Department of Theatre, and is offered to all
undergraduate Barnard College, Columbia College, and General
Studies students (the Columbia major is designated “Drama
and Theatre Arts”). The major program engages the disciplines
of drama, theatre, and performance studies as a distinctive
mode of intellectual and artistic inquiry. While Barnard and
Columbia students fulfill the overall graduation requirements at
their respective institutions (the Core at Columbia, Foundations
at Barnard), major requirements are the same for all majors,
who take foundational coursework in the literary, cultural, and
embodied traditions of western and non-Western performance
as well as courses in the practices of acting, directing, design,
dramaturgy, playwriting, and management and technical theatre.
All majors then specialize in a specific area and undertake
advanced thesis work, leading either to a formal essay of
original research, or to an artistic project (in acting, design,
directing, dramaturgy, playwriting, solo performance, or stage
and production management) that combines the practices of
research and artistic creation. Barnard and Columbia students
receive their degrees from their respective colleges of Columbia
University.
The Barnard College Department of Theatre mounts a full
season of productions in the Minor Latham Playhouse and
the Glicker-Milstein Theatre, a crucible of investigation that
is a credit-bearing element of the curriculum, and open to all
undergraduate students for audition. A collaboration between
students and professional theatre artists, the Department of
Theatre productions are both a learning process and a scene of
encounter, where perceptions are shaped for the attention and
creative reflection of a larger public.
Barnard students may declare the major at any time; Columbia
students have a major-selection period in the second year, but
all students must declare the major by the spring semester of
the sophomore year. The major requirements are spelled out
below, and the process for choosing a thesis area as well: all
Theatre/Drama and Theatre Arts majors complete a thesis as a
capstone to their work in the degree. For more information about
the major, please contact the Theatre Department office.
All majors must submit the online Theatre Major Declaration
Form, available on the Department of Theatre website
(theatre.barnard.edu); Barnard majors must also submit the
Barnard Major Declaration Form via Slate. Prior to declaring
the major, students should make an appointment with the
Department Chair or their undergraduate advisor. All majors
should introduce themselves to the Theatre Administrator in
333C Milbank Hall; she will add names to the departmental
listserv, and help students to keep up to date in important
information about studying in the Department.
Mission
Mission: To engage imaginatively with the inheritance of the
past, the questions of the present, and the possibilities of the
future through embodied and intellectual inquiry into theatre and
performance.
What do we value?
In the Department of Theatre, faculty, staff, and students
understand drama, theatre, and performance as artistic and
social practices, and as means and objects of study that model
the investigation and production, the making, of a sustainable,
equitable, livable future. We pursue theatre and performance
within the purpose of the university: to learn, explore, and
fashion disciplines of inquiry, new ways of knowing and so new
structures of knowledge. Theatre is a site of public encounter,
and we undertake its many forms of collaboration in order
to speak with the campus and the community, to perform an
imaginative, ethical engagement of possibility: of critical
dialogue among the arts, humanities, and sciences; of social and
climate justice; of equity and inclusion; of the manifold joys of
creative work across the regenerative interdisciplines of theatre
and performance.
275Drama and Theatre Arts
What do we do?
In the Department of Theatre, faculty, staff, and students
practice: inquiry across a range of platforms of scholarly
and artistic production that define and enlarge one another,
participating in learning modes of embodiment, of spatial array,
of visual and sonic design, of written expression, and of cultural
interpretation across a range of forms
create: make art and make scholarship, in the understanding that
theatre provides a process and a means for making oneself, and
making a livable world
learn: the historical, cultural, social, political, and aesthetic
contexts of drama, theatre and performance, and the
contemporary practices of performance as means of seeing
theatre today as an instrument of critical invention and ethical
performative intervention
collaborate: with others with different skills effectively,
productively, creatively, ethically, and equitably
is engaged with the city, with a wide range of artists and
scholars, and with our sustaining communities.

Students interested in majoring in Theatre should consider
taking three or four of the required classes in their first two
years of study: the Critical Histories of Drama, Theatre, and
Performance lectures (1 and 2), another lecture or seminar
course in the field of drama, theatre, and performance “studies,”
and/or a theatre praxis “studio” course.
General Rule: Attend the First Day of Class
Students are required to attend the first day of class; students
who do not attend the first day who are registered for the course
will be dropped. Students in acting classes who have been
admitted to the course who do not attend the first class meeting
will be dropped. Some courses determine enrollment on the first
day of class. If the course is over-enrolled, the instructor will
determine a method for deciding which students get priority, and
only those students present on the first day will be considered.
For more information on enrolling in Theatre Department
courses as a first-year student, please see here: https://
theatre.barnard.edu/courses-first-year-students
Enrolling in Courses
The Barnard College Department of Theatre is open to any and
all Columbia University undergraduates. While our productions
require auditions, the program generally is open for enrollment,
meaning interested students in or outside of the major may
participate in courses as they choose.
Acting Pre-Requisites:
All students wishing to take Acting courses in the Theatre
Department must first complete an Acting I class before moving
on to the Acting II series. (Transfer students, please discuss
transfer credit equivalencies with the Theatre Department
office.)
Please see here for an up-to-date listing of our Acting course
descriptions. Please note that Acting II: Acting Sondheim and
Acting II: Contemporary Musical Theatre requires all interested
students to submit a video singing audition as well as other
information, detailed both on our website and in the course
catalogue.
Finally, students majoring in theatre are required to apply for the
concentration field in which they will complete a senior thesis.
The application for senior thesis fields (acting, design, directing,
dramaturgy, playwriting, solo performance, research) is due
in January of the junior year (after 5th semester; 3 semesters
remaining); students must be declared majors, and have taken
Preparation for Graduate
Study
Coursework Taken Outside of
Barnard
Advanced Placement Credit
We do not count AP courses toward the major or the minor.
Columbia College Courses
Several lecture/seminar courses at Columbia University may
be counted toward the lecture/seminar requirement in the major
or minor. Majors may count up to two courses not taken in the
Department of Theatre toward the major; minors may count one.
A list of such courses (typically Shakespeare, drama courses
offered in the English department, and so on) is developed for
each semester. Columbia English (ENTA) and Barnard English
(ENTH) courses are typically counted; other courses should be
approved by the Theatre Department office.
Transfer Credit
When students wish to transfer credit to Barnard from other
institutions, their coursework is first evaluated for college
elective credit by the Registrar’s Office. If they are approved,
departments can consider these courses for credit toward the
major or minor.
Students are allowed to count up to 2 courses taken elsewhere
toward the Theatre major, provided they are similar in duration,
number of meetings, and content to courses that fulfill the major
offered in the department. Courses are evaluated by the Theatre
Department office. Students must take all courses counting
toward the minor at Barnard/Columbia. The THTR UN3150
and THTR UN3151 Critical Histories of Drama, Theatre, and
Performance cannot be substituted for coursework elsewhere.
Study Abroad Credit
Classes taken abroad through Columbia-led programs (i.e., those
administered by Columbia’s Center for Global Engagement) are
treated as Columbia courses, equivalent to those taken on the
Morningside Heights campus.
Classes taken abroad through other institutions or programs are
treated as transfer credit and are subject to the same policies as
other transfer courses. Accordingly, there will be a limit on the
278Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
number of study abroad courses taken at other institutions that
can be counted toward the major or minor.
To receive credit toward the major or minor for a study abroad
course (whether taken through a Columbia program or another
institution/program), students must submit a Study Abroad
Approval form through Slate and obtain the approval of the
Theatre Department office.
Students planning to study abroad should consult with the
Theatre Department office regarding coursework taken abroad.
Students studying in conservatory programs in London (RADA,
BADA, etc.) typically take the equivalent of 9 credits of acting
(3 studio courses) and, if they take two “studies” courses, are
awarded one “lecture/seminar” course for that work. They may
count ONE course toward the studio requirement and ONE
toward the lecture/seminar requirement.
Summer Credit
Summer courses at Barnard are equivalent to those taken during
the academic year. Courses that have been approved for the
fulfillment of departmental requirements will automatically
count toward the major/minor.

The Study of Earth and
Environmental Sciences:
The undergraduate programs in the Department of Earth and
Environmental Sciences provide an understanding of the natural
functioning of our planet and considers the consequences
of human interactions with it. Our program for majors aims
to convey an understanding of how the complex Earth
system works at a level that encourages students to think
creatively about the Earth system processes and how to address
multidisciplinary environmental problems. The breadth
of material covered provides an excellent background for
those planning to enter the professions of law, business,
diplomacy, public policy, teaching, journalism, etc. At the
same time, the program provides sufficient depth so that our
graduates are prepared for graduate school in one of the Earth
sciences. The program can be adjusted to accommodate students
with particular career goals in mind.
All majors, minors, and concentrators, when planning their
programs of study, should regularly consult the directors of
undergraduate studies and make themselves aware of the
requirements for their particular program.
Barnard College Courses
Courses taken at Barnard College can count towards the
Breadth requirement if they are science-based and 2000 level
or above. Barnard courses with STEM prerequisites can
count towards the Depth requirement. To check if Barnard
College courses will fulfill program requirements, please contact
the DUS with the course number, name, and syllabus.
Transfer Courses
Fulfillment of program requirements by earth, environmental,
and/or climate-related transfer courses will be determined by
the DUS. Please send your transcript and the course name and
syllabi to dees-dus@columbia.edu for evaluation.
For DEES majors, at least 50% of upper-level courses must be
taken at Columbia:
Climate System Science Majors: Students must take at least 3
Climate System Core courses, and at least 1 Climate Solutions,
Justice, Policy, Communications course at Columbia, from their

least 3 Depth courses and 1 Breadth course, as well as the
capstone sequence, must be taken at Columbia.
Study Abroad Courses
Courses taken abroad must be approved by the DUS ahead
of time in order to count towards the major. If you are
interested in studying abroad, please consult with the DUS
to plan your major requirements accordingly. Typically,
students can count supporting courses taken abroad, and any
earth, environmental, and/or climate-related courses must be
evaluated by the DUS. To check if Study Abroad courses will
fulfill program requirements, please contact the DUS with the
course syllabus.
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
All students majoring in DEES are required to complete the
capstone requirement during their senior year. Depending
on your major, you may have more than one option to fulfill
this requirement - EESC UN3901 Senior Seminar, EESC
U3904 Independent Research in Climate System Science, or an
approved Field Course. Please refer to the Requirements page
and the DEES website to learn more about the capstone options
for each major. Only students who complete the senior thesis
may be considered for departmental honors.
Undergraduate Research Outside of Courses
The department’s close affiliations with the Lamont-Doherty
Earth Observatory, the American Museum of Natural History
(AMNH), NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS),
the Earth Institute at Columbia (EI), and several departments
within the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied
Sciences afford opportunities for student participation
in a wide variety of current research programs. Summer
employment, research, and additional educational opportunities
are available at Lamont and GISS. The department encourages
majors to become involved in a research project by their junior
year.
Department Honors and
Prizes
The Department of Earth and Environmental Science awards
departmental honors to the major or majors in DEES judged to
have the best overall academic record. The award is accorded
to no more than 10% of the graduating class, or one student
in the case of a class smaller than 10. A grade point average
of at least 3.6 in the major and a senior thesis or equivalent
research of high quality are required. All students meeting these
requirements are automatically considered for departmental
honors.

The Study of East Asian
Languages and Cultures
The program in East Asian studies offers a wide range of courses
in a variety of disciplines, as well as training in the Chinese,
Japanese, Korean, and Tibetan languages. The program is
designed to provide a coherent curriculum for undergraduates
wishing to major in East Asian studies, with disciplinary
specialization in anthropology, art history, economics, history,
literature, philosophy, political science, sociology, or religion.
The department also offers a series of introductory and thematic
courses especially designed for students seeking to acquire some
knowledge of East Asia as part of their broader undergraduate
experience.
Student Advising
Information to be added
Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Study Abroad Courses
East Asian Studies majors or concentrators who opt to spend the
spring semester of their junior year abroad should contact the
Director of Undergraduate Studies for information about course
selection in the sophomore year.
Students planning to study abroad their junior year must take
the required disciplinary and senior thesis-related courses in the
spring of their sophomore year. Please contact the Director of
Undergraduate Studies for more details.
Through the Columbia University Center for
Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE), there are a
few study abroad options available to students:
The Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies
The Kyoto Consortium offers Columbia students the opportunity
to study in Japan with a program that offers intensive instruction
in the Japanese language and courses that explore a wide
range of topics in Japanese studies. The program is designed
to strengthen your Japanese skills through intensive language
training, cultural immersion, and regular interactions with the
local community and/or your host family.
ACADEMIC YEAR/ SEMESTER STUDY
Students should have the equivalent of two semesters (fall
departure) or three semesters (spring departure) of college-level
Japanese completed by the time of their departure. The program
is most appropriate for the junior year, but other arrangements
are considered.
Summer Courses
The Kyoto Consortium for Japanese
Studies SUMMER STUDY
Modern Japanese Track
This program is open to students in good academic standing who
have completed at least one year of college-level Japanese or the
equivalent. Recent graduates may also apply.
Classical Japanese Track
This program is open to students in good academic standing
who have completed three years of college-level Japanese or the
equivalent.
Columbia Summer in Beijing: Chinese Language
Program
The Columbia Summer in Beijing: Chinese Language program
offers Columbia students of all language levels (beginner to
advanced) the opportunity to study in Beijing and complete
one academic year of Chinese in nine weeks through intensive
courses, language exchange, drill sessions, and cultural
activities.
Columbia Summer in Shanghai: Business Chinese
The Columbia Summer in Shanghai: Business Chinese program
offers Columbia students the opportunity to learn Business
Chinese through an intensive course in which students can learn
the cultural behaviors, jargon, and linguistic styles used in a
professional environment as well as develop their resume and
interview skills for multinational businesses. Students should
have the equivalent of four semesters of college-level Chinese
completed before their departure.
For further information about all of the East Asian programs
offered through the Columbia University Center for
296Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Undergraduate Global Engagement (UGE), please contact the
assigned advisor for each program listed on the UGE website.students in the Chinese language program are eligible for the
Columbia Award for Chinese Language Study.
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Senior Thesis Coursework and RequirementsConcentrators are not eligible for departmental honors.
East Asian Studies majors who wish to write a senior thesis
apply to the EALAC Senior Thesis Program at the end of their
junior year. Students must have a minimum grade point average
of 3.6 in courses taken in the major at the time of the application.
Students interested in applying to the Senior Thesis Program
should submit the EALAC Senior Thesis Program Application
(see Undergraduate Planning Sheets and Forms). The deadline
for submitting applications is usually in late April or early May.
Please contact the Academic Coordinator for more information
about the application process.Professors
All potential thesis writers are required to enroll in the Senior
Thesis Research Workshop (EAAS UN3999) in the fall of
the senior year. Students who perform satisfactorily in this
workshop, successfully complete a thesis proposal, and find
a faculty adviser will then write the Senior Thesis itself in the
spring semester under the direction of the adviser and a graduate
student tutor (EAAS UN3901).
The senior thesis typically consists of about 30-35 pages of text
(double-spaced, normal typeface and margins) and 5-8 pages
of references. Under no circumstances should a thesis exceed
a total of 50 pages (including references), without the special
permission of the faculty adviser.
Successful completion of the thesis by the April 1 deadline in the
spring semester will be necessary but not sufficient for a student
to receive departmental honors. Normally no more than 10%
of graduating majors receive departmental honors in a given
academic year; as such, not all thesis writers will receive honors.
Department Honors and Prizes
Department Honors
In order to qualify for departmental honors, students must
have a GPA of at least 3.7 in classes for the major and have
submitted an honors senior thesis of distinction. The faculty of
the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures submits
recommendations to the College Committee on Honors for
confirmation. Normally no more than 10% of the graduating
majors in the department receive departmental honors. In
addition, EALAC students are eligible to receive both Latin and
Phi Beta Kappa Honors conferred by Columbia College and Phi
Beta Kappa inductees.
In addition, the Japanese language program awards the Keiko
Chevray Award and the Mary Hue Award for Japanese
language; the Korean language program awards The Center
for Korean Research Manhae Prize for Korean Language; and

Undergraduate Programs of
Study
Major in East Asian Studies
The requirements for this program were modified in the Spring
2017 semester. Students who declared an EAS major before
this semester have the option of following the old or the new
requirements. If you have any questions, please contact the
Director of Undergraduate Studies.
Prerequisite
Students must meet the following prerequisite prior to declaring
the East Asian Studies major: two years of Chinese, Japanese,
Korean, Tibetan, Vietnamese, or the proficiency equivalent (to
be demonstrated by placement examination).
Language Requirement
Third-year Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Tibetan, or Vietnamese
(completion of the UN3005-UN3006 level in Chinese, Japanese,
or Korean; TIBT UN3611-UN3612 level in Tibetan; VIET
UN3101-UN3102), or the proficiency equivalent (to be
demonstrated by placement examination). Students of Chinese
may also complete UN3003-UN3004 to meet the third-year
requirement.
One of the following sequences (in the target language):
CHNS UN3003
THIRD YEAR CHINESE I
& CHNS UN3004
and THIRD YEAR CHINESE II

Students who test out of three years or more of a language
must take an additional year of that language or another East
Asian language at Columbia in order to satisfy the language
requirement.
Introductory Courses
Students are required to take:
AHUM UN1400
COLLOQUIUM ON MAJOR
TEXTS
Students must also select two of the following:
ASCE UN1359
INTRO TO EAST ASIAN CIV:
CHINA
ASCE UN1361

ASCE UN1363
INTRO TO EAST ASIAN CIV:
KOREA
ASCE UN1365
INTRO EAST ASIAN CIV:
TIBET
ASCE UN1367
INTRO EA CIV: VIETNAM
First-year students and sophomores, prior to declaring an East
Asian studies major, are strongly urged to take one or more of
the introductory courses.
Methodology Course
All majors must take EAAS UN3990 APPROACHES TO E
ASIAN STUDIES the fall of their junior year. Please note that
this course is only offered in the fall semester.
Students interested in applying to the Senior Thesis Program
should submit the EALAC Senior Thesis Program Application
(see Undergraduate Planning Sheets and Forms). The deadline
for submitting applications is usually in late April or early May.
Please contact the Academic Coordinator for more information
about the application process.
All potential thesis writers are required to enroll in the Senior
Thesis Research Workshop (EAAS UN3999) in the fall of
the senior year. Students who perform satisfactorily in this
workshop, successfully complete a thesis proposal, and find
a faculty adviser will then write the Senior Thesis itself in the
spring semester under the direction of the adviser and a graduate
student tutor (EAAS UN3901).
The senior thesis typically consists of about 30-35 pages of text
(double-spaced, normal typeface and margins) and 5-8 pages
of references. Under no circumstances should a thesis exceed
a total of 50 pages (including references), without the special
permission of the faculty adviser.
Successful completion of the thesis by the April 1 deadline in the
spring semester will be necessary but not sufficient for a student
to receive departmental honors. Normally no more than 10%
of graduating majors receive departmental honors in a given
academic year; as such, not all thesis writers will receive honors.
Elective CoursesMinor in East Asian Studies
Students must take four elective courses in East Asian studies,
to be chosen in consultation with the DUS. Two of these courses
must be EALAC or AMEC courses. Courses in a second East
Asian language (one year minimum) or a classical East Asian
language (one semester minimum) may be used to fulfill one
elective course.Prerequisite

The Study of Ecology,
Evolution & Environmental
Biology
The Department of Ecology, Evolution & Environmental
Biology (E3B) at Columbia University was established in 2001.
Although we are a relatively new department, we have grown
rapidly in the past decade. We now have an internationally
diverse student body and a broad network of supporters at
Columbia and throughout New York City. Our affiliated faculty
members come from departments at Columbia as well as from
the American Museum of Natural History, the New York
Botanical Garden, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and the
EcoHealth Alliance. Together, we provide an unparalleled
breadth and depth of research opportunities for our students.
In creating E3B, Columbia University recognized that the fields
of ecology, evolutionary biology, and environmental biology
constitute a distinct subdivision of the biological sciences with
its own set of intellectual foci, theoretical foundations, scales of
analysis, and methodologies.
E3B's mission is to educate a new generation of scientists
and practitioners in the theory and methods of ecology,
evolution, and environmental biology. Our educational programs
emphasize a multi-disciplinary perspective to understand life
on Earth from the level of organisms to global processes that
sustain humanity and all life.
To achieve this multi-disciplinary perspective, the department
maintains close ties to over 70 faculty members beyond its
central core. Thus, many faculty members who teach, advise,
and train students in research are based in other departments
on the Columbia campus or at the partner institutions. Through
this collaboration, the department is able to tap into a broad

Students intending to pursue graduate study in this field should
broaden their foundation by taking an introductory biology
course (optimally either EEEB UN2001 ENVIRONMENTAL
BIOLOGY I or EEEB UN2002 ENVIRONMENTAL
BIOLOGY II) or an advanced evolution course, a genetics
course, and a statistics course. We recommend that
those interested in either biological anthropology or
bioarchaeology take a foundation cultural anthropology
course such as ANTH UN1002 THE INTERPRETATION OF
CULTURE, ANTH UN2004 INTRO TO SOC # CULTURAL
THEORY, ANTH UN2005 THE ETHNOGRAPHIC
IMAGINATION, or ANTH UN3040 ANTHROPOLOGICAL
THEORY. Students interested in forensic anthropology
should take chemistry in lieu of of biology (though the latter
is recommended as a foundation course for all students). The
adviser makes additional recommendations dependent on the
student’s area of focus.

MINOR IN ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION,
AND ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
Beginning in fall 2024 E3B is pleased to announce a new minor
in Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology. This
minor provides both grounding in the intellectual pillars of the
department while affording students the option to explore the
broad scope of biodiversity, ecosystems, and environmental and
evolutionary biology. Students may also delve into specific
subfields such as conservation biology, botany, behavioral
biology and ecology, ecosystem ecology, primatology, or human
evolution. No previous biology background is required. Ideally,
students will take one course by the end of their second year to
see if the program is of interest, but juniors and even seniors
who develop a curiosity in the subject may complete the minor
without difficulty.
Advising: Contact the Directors of Undergraduate Programs.
Matt Palmer mp2434@columbia.edu (mp2434@columbia.edu)
advises students who have a broad organismal/ecosystem
focus corresponding to interests in the EB program; Jill Shapiro
jss19@columbia.edu advises students with a focus on human
and non-human primate evolutionary biology and behavior,
corresponding to the EBHS program. In addition to the program
advisors, guidance as to offerings and a complete list of courses
including prerequisites is available on the E3B website.

The four introductory offerings are “gateway” classes. We
recommend that students interested broadly in organismal
biology/environmental biology take either Environmental
Biology 1 or 2, or both. Those with a focus on human and non-
human primate evolutionary biology and behavior should take
either Human Origins and Evolution or Behavioral Biology
of Living Primates. This will maximize the number of upper-
level courses that would be open but there is still considerable
flexibility. There are a small number of classes without any
prerequisites and students with foundational biology courses
from either Columbia or Barnard Biology may fulfill some class
prerequisites*. Advisors will provide guidance as to offerings
and a complete list of courses including prerequisites is available
on the E3B website.GU4065 Tropical Biology (Winter Break Course in Kenya)
*BIOL2005/2006 and Barnard BIO BC1501 are similar to
EEEB2001 (Environmental Biology 1) and may substitute
this for courses requiring the latter as a prerequisite, but must
take five other courses in E3B. Since the BIOL sequence
does not include evolution (in contrast to EB1) we highly
recommend that they take Environmental Biology 2 or one
of the other foundation courses. Barnard BIO BC1500 is
similar to Environmental Biology 2 and so students who have
completed this can count it as having satisfied the introductory
course requirement, and so can take any five courses in E3B to
complete the minor.

The Study of Economics
Economics is the study of the ways in which society allocates its
scarce resources among alternative uses and the consequences
of these decisions. The areas of inquiry deal with a varied range
of topics such as international trade, domestic and international
financial systems, labor market analysis, and the study of
less developed economies. Broadly speaking, the goal of an
economics major is to train students to think analytically about
social issues and, as such, provide a solid foundation for not only
further study and careers in economics, but also for careers in
law, public service, business, and related fields.
The Economics Department offers a general economics major
in addition to five interdisciplinary majors structured to suit
the interests and professional goals of a heterogeneous student
body. All of these programs have different specific requirements
but share the common structure of core theoretical courses
that provide the foundation for higher-level elective courses
culminating in a senior seminar. Students are urged to carefully
look through the details of each of these programs and to contact
an appropriate departmental advisor to discuss their particular
interests.
Student Advising
The Department of Economics offers a variety of advising
resources to provide prospective and current undergraduate
majors and concentrators with the information and support
needed to successfully navigate through the program. These
resources are described below.
Consulting Advisors
For answers to the most common questions that students have
about the majors, the department has graduate student advisors,
who are available by e-mail at econ-advising@columbia.edu, or
during weekly office hours to meet with students.
Students should direct all questions and concerns about any
economic program to the graduate student advisors either in
person or via e-mail. The graduate student advisors can discuss
major requirements, scheduling, and major course selection,
as well as review student checklists and discuss progress in
the major. Occasionally, graduate student advisors may refer a
student to someone else in the department (such as the director
of undergraduate studies) or in the student's school for additional
advising.
Contact information and office hours for the graduate student
advisors are posted on the Advisors page Advisors page of the
departmental website in the week prior to the beginning of the
semester. Students considering one of the interdepartmental
majors should speak to both a graduate student advisor from
the Economics Department and the advisor from the other
department early in the sophomore year.
Faculty Advisors
Faculty advisors are available only to declared majors. They
are able to discuss students' academic and career goals, both in
terms of the undergraduate career and post-graduate degrees and
research. Students wishing to discuss these types of substantive
topics may request a faculty advisor by completing the google
form available on the Advisors page of the departmental
website.
The department does its best to match students with faculty
members that share similar academic interests. While faculty
advisors do not discuss major requirements—that is the role
of the graduate student advisors—they do provide guidance in
course selection as it relates to meeting a student's intellectual
goals and interests, as well as advise on career and research
options. It is recommended that students who plan on attending
a Ph.D. program in economics or are interested in pursuing
economics research after graduation request a faculty advisor.
Enrolling in Classes
Prerequisites
The Department strictly enforces all course prerequisites.
Prerequisite courses cannot be taken concurrently with or after
the course—they must be taken before the course. Students
who take a course out of sequence (before or concurrently with
its prerequisites) will not be allowed to count those credits
towards the completion of their major, and consequently will
be required to take an additional course to replace those credits.
For placement in the calculus sequence, please consult the Math
department’s section of the Bulletin. The list of Prerequisites for
Econ courses can be found on the Course Prerequisites page of
the Dept. website.
Registration for Restricted Classes
Most lecture courses are open to online Registration. However,
Seminars, Research Courses, Independent Study and Corporate
Finance are restricted. Information regarding Seminar
Registration can be found on the Senior Seminar Registration
page. Registration information for Research Course credit,
Independent Study and Corporate Finance can be found on the
Registration Information page.
309Economics
Preparing for Graduate Study
On the Preparing for Graduate School page on our website, you
will find general advice for students thinking about pursuing a
PhD in economics. All students who are considering graduate
work should review the material posted there. Since graduate
work requires more mathematical and statistical training than the
economics major, students interested in graduate work should
speak with econ-advising about planning their course schedule.
Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Advanced Placement
AP tests must be taken in both microeconomics and
macroeconomics, with a score of 5 on one test and at least a
4 on the other. Provided that this is achieved, the department
grants 4 credits for a score of 4 and 5 on the AP Economics
exam along with exemption from ECON UN1105 PRINCIPLES
OF ECONOMICS.

If you took the IB Exam and received either a 6 or a 7 or if
you took GCE A Level Exams and received an A or a B, then
you will receive credit from the college. Those credits will
automatically exempt you from the Principles requirement.
Barnard College Courses
Barnard Economics Core Courses and seminars do NOT count
towards the Columbia Economics Major or concentration.
Specifically, the following courses will NOT count toward your
major program:
ECON BC1003, ECON BC1007, ECON BC2411, ECON

Transfer Courses
Any courses taken outside of the Economics Departments at
Columbia or Barnard that you would like to apply towards
the completion of your economics degree must be approved
by the Department of Economics in addition to approval by
your school. All majors and joint majors are required to take a
minimum of 5 lecture courses from the Columbia Department of
Economics and must take their senior seminar at Columbia.
See the Transfer Credit Information page for details on which
courses may be eligible for transfer credit, as well as information
310Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
on how to apply for transfer credit. Please read the information
carefully before submitting your materials for review.
Study Abroad Courses
All students who plan to study abroad must contact Sunil Gulati
during the prior semester to get preliminary approval for any
economics courses that they intend to take abroad. Students
should also review the information posted on the Transfer Credit
Information page for details regarding which courses may be
eligible.
Summer Courses
All students who hope to take classes in the Summer outside of
Columbia University must also contact Sunil Gulati in advance
to get preliminary approval for any economics courses. Note
that students must also have approval from their school to take
Summer courses outside of Columbia.
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Undergraduate Research in Courses
All majors write a research paper in either a senior seminar or in
the honors seminar. Each semester the department offers a wide
range of senior seminars (see Senior Seminar Descriptions for
the seminars currently on offer). Seminars are small, discussion-
based courses focused on a research topic in economics.
Students are expected to attend and participate in these courses,
as well as to write an original research paper. Registration
information for senior seminars is available on the Senior
Seminar Registration page. Some students will write a senior
thesis in the Honors Seminar. Details about writing a senior
thesis are below.
Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
SENIOR HONORS THESIS
Honors Seminar
The honors seminar is a full-year course, and you will not
receive a grade until you have completed both semesters.
Completing both semesters satisfies your seminar requirement
in the economics department. If you do not complete both
semesters, however, you must take a senior seminar to graduate
as a major. For details see the Senior Honors Thesis info on the
Honors and Prizes page.
Students who successfully complete the Honors Seminar are
eligible to graduate with departmental honors in economics.
Undergraduate Research Outside of Courses
During the academic year, students may work as an RA with
a faculty member or PhD student and receive 1 – 2 credits of
either ECON GU4996 Research Credit or ECON GU4995
Research Credit (GU 4995 is for GS students only). Research
positions typically entail an average of 3 hours of work per
week per credit. Research credit may not be used as a substitute
for elective or seminar requirements in the major and students
will receive a letter grade for their work. Students considering
graduate work or writing a senior thesis in economics should
take one or more RA positions during their time at Columbia.
Information on Research Credit (GU4995 and GU4996) is
posted on the Opportunities page. Available RA positions
are posted every semester on our WIKI page, Econ Info For
Students (log-in required).
Department Honors and
Prizes
Departmental Honors
Economics majors and economics joint majors who wish to be
considered for departmental honors in economics must:
1. Have at least a 3.7 GPA in their major courses;
2. Take ECON GU4999 Senior Honors Thesis Workshop (a
one-year course);
3. Receive at least a grade of A- in ECON GU4999 Senior
Honors Thesis Workshop.
Students must apply for admission to GU4999 and details
regarding that application are included in the annual Summer
Mailing sent to all students with a declared program in
economics. Please note that ECON GU4999 Senior Honors
Thesis Workshop may be taken to fulfill the seminar
requirement for the economics major and all economics joint
majors. Normally no more than 10% of graduating majors
receive departmental honors in a given academic year. Please
see the Honors and Prizes page on the department's website for
more information.

Guidance for Undergraduate
Students in the Department
Program Planning for all Students
There are a number of resources to assist you in planning your
program in economics.
• Checklists for all programs are available on our website.
• Econ-advising is available to assist all students with
academic planning. They can be reached by email or in
person during their office hours.
• Tentative annual course offerings are posted on the website
and in departmental newsletters.
• Information for new students is posted on the Academic
Resources Fair page.
Course Numbering Structure
All economics programs begin with an introductory 1000
level course (Principles of Economics) and progress through
the required 3000 level required core economics courses
(Intermediate Micro, Intermediate Macro and Econometrics).
Most elective courses are offered at the 3000 and 4000 level and
all require that students have completed at least UN 3211 Int
Micro and UN 3213 Int Macro. The department offers a limited
number of 2000 level electives and these courses only require
that students have completed Principles of Economics.
Guidance for First-Year Students
Our Academic Resources Fair page has answers to the most
common questions of new students at Columbia. On that page
you will find information about advising, placement, course
planning, opportunities in the department and much more. If
you are interested in pursuing economics, then it is strongly
recommended that you read through the information posted here.
Guidance for Transfer Students
Our Academic Resources Fair page has answers to the most
common questions of transfer students at Columbia. On that
page you will find information about advising, placement,
course planning, opportunities in the department and much
more. If you are interested in pursuing economics, then it is
strongly recommended that you read through the information
posted here.
The Transfer Credit page has all of the information that you will
need to apply for transfer credits for economics courses that you
have taken elsewhere. Note that the economics department will
also review your transfer credits for calculus I, statistics and
accounting courses. Details about all of these courses are also
posted at Transfer Credit Information.

Prerequisites
Course prerequisites are strictly enforced. Prerequisites must be
taken before the course, not after or concurrently.
Economics courses taken before the completion of any of its
prerequisites, even with instructor approval, are not counted
toward the major, concentration, or interdepartmental majors.
Exemptions from a prerequisite requirement may only be
made, in writing, by the department's director of undergraduate
studies. Credits from a course taken prior to the completion of
its prerequisites are not counted towards the major requirements.
As a consequence, students are required to complete additional,

majors, respectively.
Students who receive a grade of D or F in a core course are
permitted to take a higher-level elective course that has that core
course as a prerequisite, so long as it is taken concurrently with
the retaking of that core course. For example, if a student fails
ECON UN3211 INTERMEDIATE MICROECONOMICS, the
student must retake it and, in the same semester, may enroll in
an elective course for which it is a prerequisite, provided that
all other prerequisites for the elective have been completed. The
same rule applies to the required math and statistics courses. For
example, if a student fails MATH UN1201 CALCULUS III , the
student may retake calculus III concurrently with Intermediate
Microeconomics. Students who must retake any core economics
or math course may not retake it concurrently with a senior
seminar; the economics core courses ECON UN3211
INTERMEDIATE MICROECONOMICS , ECON UN3213
INTERMEDIATE MACROECONOMICS , and ECON UN3412
INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMETRICS must be successfully
completed before a student may enroll in a seminar.For seminar registration details, read the information posted
on the department's Senior Seminar Registration page: http://
econ.columbia.edu/senior-seminars-registration.
A grade of W is not equivalent to a grade of D or F; it does not
qualify a student to retake the course concurrently with a higher
level course that lists the course as a prerequisite. Students who
receive a grade of W in a core course must complete the course
with a grade of C- or better before taking a course that lists it as
a prerequisite.In addition:
Mathematics
Students must consult with the Mathematics Department for the
appropriate placement in the calculus sequence. Students must
complete one of the following sequences:

Students should always first consult with econ-advising to
confirm that the Barnard elective they wish to take does not
overlap with a Columbia elective that they have already taken or
plan to take. Students may not take the Barnard core economics,
math, statistics, or seminar courses for credit towards the
completion of major requirements.
School of Professional Studies Courses
The Department of Economics does not accept any of the
courses offered through the School of Professional Studies
for credit towards the economics major, concentration, or
interdepartmental majors with the exception of the courses
offered by the Economics Department during the summer
session at Columbia.
Other Department and School Courses
Please note that with the exception of the above Barnard
courses and the specific courses listed below for the financial
economics major, no other courses offered through the different
departments and schools at Columbia count toward the
economics majors or concentration.
Transfer Credits
Students are required to take a minimum number of courses
in the Columbia Economics Department. For all majors and
interdepartmental majors, students must complete a minimum
of five lecture courses in the Columbia department. Students
may fulfill their remaining requirements for economics lecture
courses through AP (or IB or GCE) credits, Barnard electives,
transfer courses, and study abroad courses (the latter two are
subject to the approval of the Economics Department). The
following table summarizes the new rules:

the instructor;
3. Outside courses include AP (or IB or GCE) credits, transfer
credits, Barnard 2000- and 3000-level elective courses and
transfer credits from other universities. In the case where
two or more courses taken outside of Columbia are used
as the equivalent of ECON UN1105 PRINCIPLES OF
ECONOMICS, those courses are counted as one transfer
course.
316Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
4. At least one of the core finance courses, ECON UN3025
FINANCIAL ECONOMICS and ECON GU4280
CORPORATE FINANCE, must be taken at Columbia.
Approval of transfer credits to fulfill economics requirements
must be obtained in writing from the Department of Economics
(see the departmental website or speak with your advising
dean for information regarding applications for transfer credit).
Approval is granted only for courses that are considered to be
comparable to those offered at Columbia.
Summer courses taken at other institutions must be approved
in writing by the department's transfer credit adviser before the
course is taken. The department does not accept transfer credits
for any 3000 level core courses taken during a summer session
outside of Columbia University. Summer courses taken from
the department of economics at Columbia University do not
need approval.
Guidelines and instructions on how to request transfer credit
approval can be found in the Transfer Credit Information page
of the departmental website.

THE STUDY OF EDUCATION
The Barnard Education Program envisions education as an
emancipatory human right that develops people’s capacities
to think critically and act creatively for peace, justice, and
sustainability in local and global contexts. Education is a
fundamental human activity that occurs in formal and informal
settings as people interact within their social, historical, and
physical environments. The program educates students to
draw on interdisciplinary research and perspectives in order to
critically analyze the role of education in society, and to create
and sustain equitable educational practices and policies for all.
PROGRAMS OF STUDY
The Barnard Education Program is committed to strengthening
public education and addressing issues of equity and social
justice, particularly in urban schools. We offer two tracks
in Education: Education Studies (Major and Minor/Special
Concentration), and Urban-Teaching Minors/Special
Concentration (that leads to teacher certification in Elementary/
Childhood Education or Secondary-Adolescent Education).
In all tracks, students develop critical lenses to understand
education as a fundamental human activity that occurs across
many settings; to analyze the issues facing public schools; and
to consider ways to promote fair and inclusive policies and
practices for children and youth. The classes are open to all
undergraduates at Columbia (BC, SEAS, GS, CC). The two
tracks we offer are:
Education Studies
Education Studies is an interdisciplinary program for students
who wish to understand, critically analyze, and conduct research
on the role of education in society. Our students draw on a wide
range of theoretical and empirical scholarship to study education
as a social, cultural, and historical process. We understand
education as much more than schooling, even as schooling is
central to many of our concerns. Students who pursue the major
or the minor/special concentration in Education Studies learn
to evaluate educational policy, practice, and research through
a critical, equity-oriented lens. Our graduates will be prepared
to act creatively for peace, justice, and sustainability in local
and global educational contexts. Education Studies prepares
students to pursue graduate studies or positions in public policy,
sociology, history, youth studies, philosophy, psychology,
and other areas where K-12 education is frequently a focus
of coursework and scholarship, as well as to pursue teacher
certification through a graduate program. Education Studies does
not lead to teacher certification.
Education Studies Major: The Education Studies major
is designed for students whose primary interest is in pursuing
Education as their major course of study. Education Studies
majors concentrate in one of three areas: Education, Culture, and
Society; Educational Policy; or Comparative and International
Education. In their senior year, they conduct an original inquiry
project. Currently, the major in Education Studies is open to
Barnard College students only.
Education Studies Minor/Special Concentration:
Education Studies minors (BC) or special concentrations
(CC, GS) pursue similar coursework to that undertaken by
the majors. This course of study is intended to complement
a major's disciplinary specialization and methodological
training. In addition to the requirements of the minor/special
concentration, students must complete a major. The special
concentration minors are open to all students at Barnard College,
Columbia College, and College of General Studies.
For further information, and to apply to the major or minor
tracks, please visit our website
Urban Teaching Minors/Special Concentrations
This track is for students who want to graduate from college
with teacher certification. Our goal is to prepare students to
become skilled and reflective teachers who can effectively
respond to the learning needs of diverse learners, and
create supportive and intellectually stimulating classroom
communities. Students learn to create innovative curriculum;
gain experience observing, tutoring, and teaching a diverse range
of children and young people; develop confidence in their role
as teachers who can promote fair and inclusive school practices;
and graduate with certification to teach in New York.
This program is registered by the New York State Department
of Education and accredited by the Association for Advancing
Quality in Educator Preparation (AAQEP). Students who
complete the program will be recommended for Initial
Certification in either Childhood Education (Grades 1-6) or
Adolescent Education (Grades 7-12). We provide ongoing
support to program completers through our Barnard Teacher
Network.

year should apply by the spring of the freshman year, but no
later than the first Tuesday in September of the sophomore year.
Admission criteria include good academic standing; evidence of
commitment to the field of education; interest in issues of social
justice issues as they affect education, particularly in urban
schools; and capacity for growth as an intellectually resourceful
and reflective teacher. Enrollment is limited.

member of the department’s Committee on Undergraduate
Education (CUE). The DUS and CUE are the department’s de
facto academic advisors, and hold open office hours each week
to offer guidance to majors, minors, and concentrators, as well as
those interested in declaring in future.
Newly-declared majors or minors should make an appointment
with the DUS or a CUE member to discuss their academic
plans as soon as possible after declaration. They should also
contact the Undergraduate Coordinator and request that their
names be added to the department’s listserv, which disseminates
information and updates about courses, events, deadlines, and
other matters.
Throughout the year, the CUE will also organize dedicated
information sessions about graduate study, professional
development, fellowship and prize applications, and more.
The Study of English and
Comparative LiteratureCourse Information
Lectures
The program in English fosters the ability to read critically and
imaginatively, to appreciate the power of language to shape
thought and represent the world, and to be sensitive to the
ways in which literature is created and achieves its effects.
It has several points of departure, grounding the teaching of
critical reading in focused attention to the most significant works
of English literature, in the study of the historical and social
conditions surrounding literary production and reception, and in
theoretical reflection on the process of writing and reading and
the nature of the literary work.Seminars
The courses the department offers draw on a broad range of
methodologies and theoretical approaches, from the formalist
to the political to the psychoanalytical (to mention just a few).
Ranging from the medieval period to the 21st century, the
department teaches major authors alongside popular culture,
traditional literary genres alongside verbal forms that cut across
media, and canonical British literature alongside postcolonial,
global, and trans-Atlantic literatures.
At once recognizing traditional values in the discipline
and reflecting its changing shape, the major points to three
organizing principles for the study of literature—history, genre,
and geography. Requiring students not only to take a wide
variety of courses but also to arrange their thinking about
literature on these very different grids, the major gives them
broad exposure to the study of the past, an understanding of the
range of forms that can shape literary meaning, and an encounter
with the various geographical landscapes against which literature
in English has been produced.
Student Advising
Consulting Advisers
Questions about coursework or program requirements can be
addressed to the department’s Undergraduate Coordinator,
to the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS), or to any
Generally, lectures are addressed to a broad audience and do not
assume previous course work in the area, unless prerequisites
are noted in the description. The size of some lectures is limited.
Senior majors have preference unless otherwise noted, followed
by junior majors, followed by senior and junior non-majors.
Students are responsible for checking for any special registration
procedures on-line at https://english.columbia.edu/content/
course-listings.
The department regards seminars as opportunities for students
to do advanced undergraduate work in fields in which they have
already had some related course experience. With the exception
of some CLEN classes (in which, as comparative courses, much
material is read in translation), students’ admission to a seminar
presupposes their having taken ENGL UN2000 Approaches to
Literary Study. During the three weeks preceding the registration
period, students should check https://english.columbia.edu/
content/course-listings for application instructions for individual
seminars. Applications to seminars are usually due by the end
of the week preceding registration. Students should always
assume that the instructor’s permission is necessary; those who
register without having secured the instructor’s permission are
not guaranteed admission.
Undergraduate Research
Opportunities
Independent Study Projects
During the regular academic semester, students may design
and undertake an individualized Independent Study with the
sponsorship of a faculty member, in order to pursue a particular
interest that is not represented in a given semester’s course
offerings.
327English and Comparative Literature
Most Independent Study projects are awarded 3 points of
academic credit, but proposals can stipulate anywhere from 1-4
points, depending on workload. For guidance on course points,
see here.
To propose an Independent Study, please complete this form and
submit it to the Undergraduate Coordinator no later than two
weeks prior to the start of classes, for review by the DUS and
CUE.
Note that you cannot register for an independent study without
official departmental approval.
The Richmond Williams Travelling Fellowship
The Williams Fellowship supports summer research projects
requiring foreign travel, with grants of up to $6000.00. The
competition is open to any Columbia College junior majoring
in English and Comparative Literature. Recipients of the award
must undertake a significant piece of independent scholarship
based on their research in the senior year – either as an
independent study, or as part of the Senior Essay program. The
application can be found on the department website here. Note:
it is highly recommended that applicants review Columbia’s
Undergraduate International Travel Policy before and during the
application process.
The Humanities Research Scholars Program
The Humanities Research Scholars Program (HRSP) offers
a select group of rising juniors at Columbia College the
opportunity to pursue independent research projects and to
develop analytical and investigative skills that will serve them
well in any future endeavor. This program is designed to help
students learn from one another as well as from leaders in the
academic and professional world, and to support students in
their intellectual pursuits and their future growth. It focuses on
students interested in research in the humanities or humanistic
social sciences.
Humanities Research Scholars will engage in two main pursuits
over the course of one summer session of research: (1) the
development of knowledge, skills, and approaches to the study
of the humanities that will be transferable to any professional
field; and (2) the development of an independent research
project over six weeks of the summer that allows the exploration
of a specific topic with guidance from a faculty member.
Learn more about the HRSP here.
Other opportunities
The Undergraduate Research and Fellowships office frequently
posts opportunities for research across fields, here. Within
English, faculty occasionally seek research assistants for help
on specific projects; such calls for research assistants are usually
made through the departmental listserv.
The Senior Essay Program
The Senior Essay program is an opportunity for majors in
English and Comparative Literature to explore some literary
topic of special interest to them in depth. Essay projects
typically involve extensive critical reading and/or original
research, and result in a piece of written work (approximately
10,000 words) that constitutes a substantial critical or scholarly
argument.
To undertake a Senior Essay, students must first register for the
fall research methods seminar, ENGL UN3795. In the spring,
essayists then continue work on their projects with the guidance
of a dedicated faculty advisor, and submit their final drafts
in April. Examples of past Senior Essays in English can be
found here.
Note that English majors are not required to write a
Senior Essay (although it is a requirement for eligibility for
Departmental Honors).
Departmental Honors and
Academic Prizes
Departmental Honors:
Each year, in consultation with the faculty, the CUE awards
Departmental Honors to no more than 10% of graduating
majors. Honors are determined on the basis of the Senior
Essay, as well as performance in departmental coursework and
participation in departmental culture.
Academic Prizes:
The English department awards numerous prizes for critical and
creative writing each year; information about these prizes can be
found here.
The Degree Audit Reporting
System (DARS)
The DAR is a useful tool for students to monitor their progress
toward degree requirements, but it is not an official document
for the major or concentration, nor should it replace consultation
with departmental advisers. The department’s director of
undergraduate studies is the final authority on whether
requirements for the major have been met. Furthermore, the
DAR may be inaccurate or incomplete for any number of
reasons—for example, courses taken elsewhere and approved for
credit do not show up on the DAR report as fulfilling a specific
requirement.
Students should fill out a Major Requirements Worksheet early
in the semester preceding graduation. The worksheet must be
reviewed by an adviser and submitted to 602 Philosophy before
the registration period for the final semester. The worksheet
is available in the English Department or on the department
website here.

Program Planning for all Students
There are many paths through a degree in English and
Comparative Literature, even within the requirements described
below. Students considering a major or minor are encouraged
to make an appointment with the DUS to discuss their particular
interests and goals. They should also feel free to enroll in one of
the department’s gateway lectures (1000-level), which have no
prerequisites. Students who are already embarked on a degree
in English should also be sure to check in with the DUS or a
member of CUE regularly to ensure that they complete their
requirements in the most rewarding way possible.
Enrolling in Courses
In the weeks before registration, the departmental website will
continually update course information, including prerequisites
and course caps. Please be sure to check each course’s
particular registration guidelines, as these can vary dramatically;
for seminars, in particular, instructor permission is required
for enrollment, and instructors will often require a specific
application in order to consider any student for admission.
Approaches to Literary Study
The introductory course ENGL UN2000 Approaches to Literary
Study, together with its companion seminar, ENGL UN2001
Approaches to Literary Study Seminar, is required for the
English major, minor, or concentration. It should be taken by
the end of the sophomore year. Fulfillment of this requirement
is a factor in admission to seminars and to some lectures. This
once-a-week faculty lecture, accompanied by a seminar led by
an advanced graduate student in the department, is intended

specialization, and maintain a 3.6 GPA in the major. In lieu
of a fifth elective, Honors majors are required to enroll in the
following course in the spring semester of their senior year,
during which they are required to write a thesis:
CSER UN3990 Senior Project Seminar (4 points)
Honors majors are required to present their senior essays at the
annual undergraduate symposium in April. Students may fulfill
this option in one of the following two ways:
1. By matriculating in the Senior Thesis course and writing the
thesis under the supervision of the course faculty.
332Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
2. By taking an additional 4-point seminar where a major paper
is required and further developing the paper into a thesis
length work (minimum of 30 pages) under the supervision of
a CSER faculty member.
Department Honors and Prizes
Department Honors
CSER majors may choose to write and/or produce an honors
project. The senior thesis gives undergraduate majors the
opportunity to engage in rigorous, independent, and original
research on a specific topic of their choosing. If a monograph,
the honors thesis is expected to be 35-50 pages in length.
Honors projects can also take other forms, such as video or
websites. These projects also require a written component,
but of a shorter length than the traditional thesis. During their
senior year, honors students perform research as part of CSER
UN3990 Senior Project Seminar. Senior projects are due in early
April. The Honors Thesis is an excellent option for any student
interested in pursuing a Master’s degree or Ph.D. Students
should consult with their director of undergraduate studies no
later than the beginning of the first term of their senior year if
they wish to be considered for departmental honors. Students
who are awarded departmental honors are notified by their
department in mid-May.
In order to qualify for departmental honors, students must satisfy
all the requirements for the major, maintain a GPA of at least
3.6 in the major, and complete a high quality honors project. In
addition, each student is expected to meet periodically with his
or her supervising project adviser and preceptor. Although the
senior thesis is a prerequisite for consideration for departmental
honors, all Ethnicity and Race studies majors are strongly
encouraged to consider undertaking thesis work even if they do
not wish to be considered for departmental honors.
Academic Prizes
In addition to departmental honors, CSER also confers the
following awards to two graduating seniors:
CSER Award for Outstanding Thesis
• A CSER faculty committee will review all senior projects
and will select one for the Outstanding Thesis award.
• As part of its deliberation process, the committee reviews
recommendations made by CSER faculty, the Modes of
Inquiry# course instructor and the CSER preceptor. In order
to receive this award, the student must keep a GPA of 3.6 or
above in the major courses.
CSER Award for Academic Excellence
• CSER confers this award to a student who has consistently
demonstrated her/his intellectual capacity in and outside the
classroom. In order to receive this award, the student must
keep a GPA of 3.6 or above in the major courses.

Undergraduate Programs of
Study
The Ethnicity and Race Studies major and concentration
encompass a variety of fields and interdisciplinary approaches to
the critical study of ethnicity and race.
Faculty and students find this field exciting because it opens up
new ways of thinking about two fundamental aspects of human
social existence: race and ethnicity. Although various traditional
disciplines such as history, sociology, anthropology, and
literature offer valuable knowledge on the subject, ethnicity and
race studies provides a flexible interdisciplinary and comparative
space to bring the insights of various conceptual frameworks and
disciplines together in critical dialogue.
Overall, the major introduces students to the study of ethnicity
and race and the deep implications of the subject matter for
thinking about human bodies, power, identity, culture, social
hierarchy, and the formation of political communities. The
333Ethnicity and Race Studies
major encourages students to consider the repercussions of racial
and ethnic identifications to local and global politics, and how
race and ethnicity relates to gender, sexuality, and social class,
among other forms of hierarchical difference.
Students majoring in ethnicity and race studies may focus their
work on specific groups, including Asian Americans, Latinos,
and Native Americans, and/or concentrate on the comparative
study of how race and ethnic categories are formed and how
they transform. Students also have the option of designing
an individualized course of study. Individualized courses of
study may encompass a wide variety of themes. Among the
most studied are those involving the relationship between race,
ethnicity and law; health; human rights; urban spaces; cultural
production; visual culture; and the environment.
Due to its rigorous curriculum, which trains students in theory,
history, and a wide range of modes of inquiry, the major
enables a student to follow multiple directions after graduation.
According to our internal surveys, nearly half of CSER students
continue to graduate programs in history, anthropology, and
ethnic studies, among other areas. A second group of students
pursues a variety of professions, most notably related to law,
medicine, media, social work, government, and human rights.
Major in Ethnicity and Race
Studies
The requirements for this program were modified on March
2022. Students who declared this program before this date
should contact the director of undergraduate studies for the
department in order to confirm their correct course of study.
The major in ethnicity and race studies consists of a minimum of
27 points. All majors are required to take three core courses as
listed below:
Majors who elect NOT to follow the Honors track must
complete at least five CSER elective courses, in consultation
with their major adviser, within their area of specialization.
At least one of these electives must be a writing-intensive
seminar (3000 or above level courses must be chosen within
the department). Majors who elect to follow the Honors
track must complete at least four CSER elective courses, in
consultation with their major adviser, within their area of
specialization.
Honors
In lieu of a fifth elective, Honors majors are required to enroll
in the following course in the spring semester of their senior
year, during which they are required to write a thesis:
CSER UN3990
SENIOR PROJECT SEMINAR
Honors majors are required to present their senior essays at
the annual undergraduate symposium in April. Students may
fulfill this option in one of the following two ways:
1. By matriculating in the Senior Thesis course and writing
the thesis under the supervision of the course faculty.
2. By taking an additional 4-point seminar where a major
paper is required and further developing the paper into
a thesis length work (minimum of 30 pages) under the
supervision of a CSER faculty member.
Language Courses
- One of the following is highly recommended, although not
required for the major:
- One course beyond the intermediate-level in language
pertinent to the student's focus
- An introductory course in a language other than that used
to fulfill the degree requirements, but that is pertinent to
the student's focus
- A linguistics or other course that critically engages
language
- An outside language and study abroad programs that
include an emphasis on language acquisition

majors take a combination of history survey courses; workshops
("Labs"); and advanced classes in theory, genre study, national
cinemas, auteur study, and screenwriting.
The educational goal is to provide film majors with a solid
grounding in the history and theory of film; its relation to other
forms of art; and its synthesis of visual storytelling, technology,
economics, and sociopolitical context, as well as the means to
begin writing a script and making a short film.
Students who wish to graduate with honors must take the
SENIOR SEMINAR IN FILM STUDIES (FILM UN3900),
writing a thesis that reflects mastery of cinematic criticism. The
essay is submitted after the winter break. Students decide upon
the topic with the professor and develop the essay during the fall
semester.
Since film courses tend to be popular, it is imperative that
students attend the first class. Registration priority is usually
given to film majors and seniors.

Barnard College Courses
The major in film studies is scholarly, international in scope, and
writing-intensive. Students choose to major in film if they want
to learn more about the art form, from technology to cultural
significance; want to work in the film industry; or are interested
in a major that combines arts and humanities.
Students usually declare the major toward the end of the second
year by meeting with the departmental adviser; together, they
create a program of twelve required courses within the major,
often supplemented by courses outside the department. In
the lecture classes and seminars, there tends to be a mixed
population of undergraduate majors and graduate film students.
Students have the opportunity to gain additional experience
by taking advantage of internship opportunities with film
companies, working on graduate student films, and participating
in the Columbia Undergraduate Film Productions (CUFP),
an active, student-run organization that provides film-making
experience to Columbia undergraduate producers and directors.
In addition to careers in screenwriting, directing, and producing,
alumni have gone on to work in film distribution, publicity,
archives, and festivals, and to attend graduate school to become
teachers and scholars.
The trajectory of the major is from introductory-level courses
(three are required), to intermediate and advanced-level courses
(two are required, plus seven electives). While film studies
majors take workshops in screenwriting and film-making, the
course of study is rooted in film history, theory, and culture.
The prerequisite for all classes is INTRO TO FILM # MEDIA
STUDIES (FILM UN1000) offered each term at Columbia as
well as at Barnard, and open to first-year students. Subsequently,

French and Francophone
Studies
The undergraduate Major in French and Francophone Studies
and Minor in French and Francophone Studies give students an
overview of French and francophone literature, culture, politics,
and societies from the Middle Ages to the present. Students
take a series of required courses in which they hone their
linguistic skills (primarily with Read, Think, Write in French)
before delving into the study of literature, culture, politics and
society with Introduction to French and Francophone Studies:
History and Introduction to French and Francophone Studies:
Literature, and the Senior Seminar in which students refine
their understanding of literary analysis, works and methods and
are introduced to research in French and francophone studies.
Students also take advanced electives on any aspect of French or
francophone literature, culture, or history.
The optional Senior Essay, written under the guidance of a
faculty member at Columbia or during a student’s semester
abroad, provides an initiation to scholarly research. It is a
requirement to be eligible for departmental honors.
Seeing as a direct experience of contemporary French society
is an essential part of the program, students are strongly
encouraged to spend a summer, a semester or an academic year
at Reid Hall-Columbia University in Paris, where they can take
courses that will be credited toward the French major as well
as to other majors including Political Sciences, History or Art
History. Qualified students may also take courses directly in the
French university system.
Please reach out to the Director of Undergraduate Studies for
Majors’ and Minors’ Worksheets (for French and Francophone
Studies), which provide a breakdown of course requirements.
Student Advising
All advising for undergraduate students pursuing a French and
Francophone studies major and minor is handled by the Director
of Undergraduate Studies. Students with questions regarding
language requirements should contact the Director of the French
Language Program.
Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Advanced Placement
Entering students are placed, or exempted, on the basis of their
College Board Achievement or Advanced Placement scores,
or their scores on the placement test taken online: FRENCH
PLACEMENT TEST. An SAT score of 780 or a score of 5 on
the AP exam satisfies the language requirement. Students with
a score of 4 on the AP exam will be placed in Intermediate II,
but may attempt to place out by requesting to take an oral exam
administered by the Director of the Language Program.
Barnard College Courses
Many advanced literature and culture courses at Barnard College
may fulfill elective credits for the French major or minor at
Columbia, pending approval by the Director of Undergraduate
Studies. Please note: The Barnard course, FREN BC1204
Intermediate II does not fulfill the undergraduate language
requirement.
Transfer Courses
Transfer students may apply a limited number of qualifying
credits from other institutions to elective courses in the French
major and minor, pending approval from the Director of
Undergraduate Studies. Students should be expected to present
syllabi and transcripts for courses at previous institutions.
Study Abroad
Seeing as a direct experience of contemporary French society
is an essential part of the program, students are strongly
encouraged to spend either a summer term, a semester, or a
full, academic year at Reid Hall, Columbia University’s Global
Center in Paris, where they can take courses that will be credited
toward the French major as well as to other majors (e.g. history,
art history, political science) and the global core. Qualified
students may also take courses directly in the French university
system.

Undergraduate Research and
Senior Essay
Senior Essay
The Senior Essay offers students an opportunity to immerse
themselves in a research project and to hone their research and
writing skills. It substitutes for an elective and makes the student
eligible for departmental honors. The essay (25 pages minimum,
in French) is usually written under the direction of a tenured or
tenure-faculty faculty member (assistant professor, associate
professor, or professor). Occasionally, with the permission of the
DUS, the essay may be written under the direction of a lecturer.
Only students who choose to write a Senior Essay are eligible
for departmental honors.
The Senior Essay is a year-long project. Students are required
to meet with the DUS to discuss their choice of adviser. They
should do so preferably before the end of the spring semester
of their junior year and no later than September 15th of their
senior year. Once they have established a relationship with their
adviser, they should have their research project approved by the
latter, with a copy to the DUS (no later than October 15th). In
the Spring, students should register for the Senior Tutorial in
Literature (FREN UN3996). Students developing a Senior Essay
are still required to take the Senior Seminar (FREN UN3995) in
their senior year.
Undergraduate Research outside of Courses
The Department of French fosters students’ research and critical
thinking skills both inside and outside of the classroom. During
their studies, interested students are encouraged to apply for
undergraduate research funding opportunities, awarded by

Undergraduate Research Fellowship
Every year, the Department of French awards the French and
Francophone Studies Undergraduate Research Fellowship.
The fellowship is intended to support students majoring in the
humanities or the social sciences pursuing research in France
or a francophone country or region during the summer between
their junior and senior years. Please visit this website for up-to-
date information.
Department Honors
Majors who wish to be considered for departmental honors
should consult with the director of undergraduate studies.
To be eligible for departmental honors, students must have a
grade point average of at least 3.7 in major courses and have
completed an approved senior essay (information below) under
the guidance of a faculty member at Columbia or Reid Hall.
Normally no more than 10% of graduating majors receive
departmental honors in a given academic year.

level French courses in order to receive these 3 credits, but
restrictions apply on the use of these credits toward the
French major.
Language Laboratory and On-line Materials
Language laboratories located in the International Affairs
Building provide opportunities for intensive practice in French
pronunciation and aural comprehension. French courses
typically make extensive use of on-line interactive materials that
students can access from their own computers.
Maison Française
Students interested in French should acquaint themselves with
the Maison Française, which houses a reading room of French
newspapers, periodicals, books, and videos, and sponsors

For those students who would like to minor in French and
francophone studies, please consult our website and the
information below. Each student’s program of study is to be
discussed regularly with the Director of Undergraduate Studies,
starting in the spring semester of the sophomore year.
COURSES
The minor is composed of five courses, or a minimum of 15
points beyond the language requirement / prerequisite (FREN
UN2102), which are distributed as follows.
CORE (6 points):
• FREN UN3405 “Read, Think, Write in French” (Formerly
titled “Advanced Grammar and Composition”)
• One of our two core interdisciplinary, undergraduate survey
courses, which cover literature, history, and culture from
the Middle Ages to the Present. These include either the
history survey (FREN UN3409 Introduction to French
and Francophone Studies: History) or the literature survey
(FREN UN3410 Introduction to French and Francophone
Studies: Literature).
INTERDISCIPLINARY ELECTIVES (9 points):
• The remaining three electives can be fulfilled by various
French or Francophone literature courses at the 3000 or 4000
level.
• These elective courses can include advanced literature,
culture, and history courses offered by the Department
of French, as well as our popular “French Thru/Through
X” (FREN UN32XX) courses, which reinforce advanced
French language proficiency through various cultural themes
(including Current Events, Paris, Pop Culture, the Visual
Arts, and so on).
• Students are encouraged to first complete FREN UN3405,
to prepare themselves for other, more advanced university
courses in French. One possible curriculum map is thus
to take FREN UN3405, then one core course (either the
literature or history survey courses), before completing
the three required elective courses. However, additional
core and elective courses can ultimately be taken in any
order or concurrently. Students may also opt to take the
remaining core course for an elective credit (i.e., to take both
the literature and history survey courses, and to count one
towards the minor requirement and one towards an elective
credit).
• Elective credits can also be completed while studying abroad,
either at the Columbia Undergraduate program at Reid Hall
in Paris or at partner institutions, such as Sciences Po and a
few other qualifying Parisian universities.
• Any elective courses taken at partner institutions will be
subject to DUS approval.
LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS:
• Students could begin completing their minor immediately
in their freshman year but should begin a minor no later

students will need to pass the language proficiency exam to
determine whether they need to complete first- and second-
year French courses, or whether they can pass directly to
FREN UN3405.
• All language prerequisites must be completed before taking
FREN UN3405.
• The AP French exam already fulfills the language
requirement for Columbia students, so it may not fulfill
requirements for the minor.
• Students are encouraged to study abroad at Reid Hall.

The Department of Germanic
Languages
The Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures is
considered one of the very best in the country. Many of the
faculty specialize in the study of German literature and culture
from 1700 to the present. German majors acquire proficiency
in examining literary, philosophical, and historical texts
in the original, as well as critical understanding of modern
German culture and society. Particular attention is given to
German-speaking traditions within larger European and global
contexts. Courses taught in translation build on Columbia’s Core
Curriculum, thereby allowing students to enroll in upper-level
seminars before completing the language requirement.
All classes are taught as part of a living culture. Students have
ample opportunities to study abroad, to work with visiting
scholars, and to take part in the cultural programs at Deutsches
Haus. In addition, the department encourages internships with
German firms, museums, and government offices. This hands-
on experience immerses students in both language and culture,
preparing them for graduate study and professional careers.
Upon graduation, German majors compete successfully for
Fulbright or DAAD scholarships for research in Germany or
Austria beyond the B.A. degree. Our graduating seniors are
highly qualified to pursue graduate studies in the humanities and
social sciences, as well as professional careers. Former majors
and concentrators have gone on to careers in teaching, law,
journalism, banking and consulting, international affairs, and
communications.
German literature and culture courses are taught as seminars
integrating philosophical and social questions. Topics include
romanticism, revolution, and national identity; German
intellectual history; minority literatures; Weimar cinema;
German-Jewish culture and modernity; the Holocaust and
memory; and the history and culture of Berlin. Classes are small,
with enrollment ranging from 5 to 15 students.
The department regularly offers courses in German literature
and culture in English for students who do not study the German
language. The department also participates in Columbia’s
excellent program in comparative literature and society.
The Yiddish Studies Program
The Yiddish Studies Program at Columbia University, the global
leader in Yiddish scholarship and teaching, focuses on the
experiences and cultural efflorescence of Ashkenazic Jewry over
a thousand years and five continents. It is a perfect exemplar of
Columbia’s interests in global and transnational study, weaving
together language, literature, and culture in a way that echoes the
best of Columbia’s justly famed humanities programs.
The program in Yiddish studies offers both the undergraduate
Major, Concentration and three new Minor tracks, in
addition to graduate studies leading to the Ph.D. In both the
undergraduate and graduate program, emphasis is placed not
merely on acquiring linguistic proficiency and textual study,
but also viewing Yiddish literature in a larger cultural and
interdisciplinary context. The graduate program, the only
degree-granting Yiddish Studies Program in the United States, is
considered one of the world’s most important, with its graduates
holding many of the major university positions in the field.
Students of Yiddish have ample opportunities to enhance their
studies through a number of fellowships. The Naomi Fellowship,
a fully-subsidized Yiddish Study Abroad program allows
students to explore Yiddish culture and history in Israel and
Poland. The Irene Kronhill Pletka YIVO Fellowship enables
students to expand on their archival research skills in New York.
Upon graduation, our majors compete successfully for Fulbright
and other prestigious scholarships, and are highly qualified to
pursue careers in humanities, social sciences, as well as artistic
and professional careers.
Students work with faculty in Germanic languages,
Jewish studies, history, and Slavic studies to broaden their
understanding of the literature, language, and culture of Eastern
European Jewry. The Yiddish Studies Program is also closely
affiliated with the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies, which
offers diverse programming and other fellowship opportunities.
Classes are small, and instruction is individualized and carefully
directed to ensure that students gain both a thorough general
grounding and are able to pursue their own particular interests in
a wide-spanning field. The program also offers classes taught in
translation for students who do not study Yiddish. The Yiddish
programming, such as lectures, monthly conversation hours,
Meet a Yiddish Celebrity series, as well as the activities of the
Yiddish Club of Columbia’s Barnard/Hillel allows students to
explore Yiddish culture outside the classroom.

The German Language Placement Exam
The German Language Placement Exam is offered every
semester to students who already speak the language in order
to determine their language level (Elementary, Intermediate,
Advanced) and the right level language course. Visit our website
for details.
The German Language Program
First- and second-year German language courses emphasize
spoken and written communication, and provide a basic
introduction to German culture. Goals include mastery of the
structure of the language and enough cultural understanding to
interact comfortably with native speakers.
After successfully completing the elementary German
sequence, GERM UN1101 ELEMENTARY GERMAN I-
GERM UN1102 , students are able to provide information
about themselves, their interests, and daily activities. They
can participate in simple conversations, read edited texts,
and understand the main ideas of authentic texts. By the end
of GERM UN1102 , students are able to write descriptions,
comparisons, and creative stories, and to discuss general
information about the German-speaking countries.
The intermediate German sequence, GERM UN2101
INTERMEDIATE GERMAN I-GERM UN2102
INTERMEDIATE GERMAN II, increases the emphasis on
reading and written communication skills, expands grammatical
mastery, and focuses on German culture and literary texts.
Students read short stories, a German drama, and increasingly
complex texts. Regular exposure to video, recordings, the World
Wide Web, and art exhibits heightens the cultural dimensions
of the third and fourth semesters. Students create portfolios
comprised of written and spoken work.
Entering students are placed, or exempted, on the basis of
their College Board Achievement or Advanced Placement
scores, or their scores on the placement test administered by
the departmental language director. Students who need to take
GERM UN1101 ELEMENTARY GERMAN I-GERM UN1102
ELEMENTARY GERMAN II may take GERM UN1125
Accelerated Elementary German I & II as preparation for
GERM UN2101 INTERMEDIATE GERMAN I.

for German Studies in Berlin. Advanced-level courses focus
on more sophisticated use of the language structure and
composition (GERM UN3001 ADVANCED GERMAN
I-GERM UN3002 ADVANCED GERMAN II ); on specific
cultural areas; and on literary, historical, and philosophical areas
in literature-oriented courses (GERM UN3333 INTRO TO
GERMAN LIT (GERMAN)).Preparing for Graduate Study
In Fulfillment of the Language Requirement in
GermanIn addition to applying for Fulbright or DAAD scholarships,
students considering graduate work may also wish to write a
senior thesis or develop an independent research project with a
faculty mentor.
Students beginning the study of German at Columbia must take
four terms of the following two-year sequence:
GERM UN1101
GERM UN1102
GERM UN2101
GERM UN2102
ELEMENTARY GERMAN I
ELEMENTARY GERMAN II
INTERMEDIATE GERMAN I
INTERMEDIATE GERMAN II
Upon graduation, German majors compete successfully for
Fulbright or DAAD scholarships for research in Germany
or Austria beyond the B.A. degree. Graduating seniors are
highly qualified to pursue graduate studies in the humanities
and social sciences, as well as professional careers. Former
majors and minors have gone on to pursue graduate degrees in
law, journalism, banking and consulting, international affairs,
education, and communications.
Students interested in pursuing a PhD or MA in the field of
Germanic Languages should therefore speak with the Director of
Undergraduate Studies and other faculty members no later than
the beginning of the fall semester before applying (i.e., typically
the fall of the senior year).
346Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Coursework in fulfillment of a major or minor [or special
program or concentration] must be taken at Columbia University
unless explicitly noted here and/or expressly permitted by the
Director of Undergraduate Studies of the program. Exceptions or
substitutions permitted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies
should be confirmed in writing by email to the student.
Advanced Placement
The department grants 3 credits for a score of 5 on the AP
German Language exam, which satisfies the foreign language
requirement. Credit is awarded upon successful completion of a
3000-level (or higher) course with a grade of B or higher. This
course must be for at least 3 points of credit and be taught in
German. Courses taught in English may not be used for language
AP credit. The department grants 0 credits for a score of 4
on the AP German Language exam, but the foreign language
requirement is satisfied.
Barnard College Courses
The German programs at Columbia and Barnard work together
closely. Students may take courses at Barnard to count towards
the Major or Minor with the approval of the DUS. Students
at Barnard should speak to their advisor at Barnard regarding
Columbia courses as the departments are distinct and the
requirements for their respective majors are different.
Transfer Courses
When students transfer to Columbia from other institutions,
their coursework at their previous institution must first be
considered by their school in order to be evaluated for degree
credit (e.g., to confirm that the courses will count toward the
124 points of credit that every student is required to complete
for the B.A. degree). Only after that degree credit is confirmed,
departments may consider whether those courses can also be
used to fulfill specific degree requirements toward a major or
minor [or special program or concentration].

FUBiS Summer Language Program in Berlin
The department offers a language-intensive German program
over the summer at the Freie Universität Berlin (FUBiS).
Financial support is provided primarily by the Germanistic
Society of America and the Max Kade Foundation, with some
help from Barnard College, Columbia College, General Studies,
Columbia Engineering, and the Department of Germanic
Languages.
The FUBiS scholarship is for students who have completed
at least two semesters or equivalent of German language
instruction in our German language program by May of the year
they are applying. Scholarships are awarded based on academic
achievement and German language aptitude. Each scholarship
includes a travel grant, tuition for a six-week/ one month-long
German language course, and lodging at the summer program of
the FU University. For additional information on FUBIS, please
contact our department and visit https://www.fubis.org.
Berlin Consortium for German Studies
The Berlin Consortium for German Studies (BCGS) provides
students with a study abroad program, administered by
Columbia University, which includes students from other
consortium member schools (Princeton, Yale, University of
Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Chicago).
You can study a semester or a full academic year. We have the
original immersion program (4 semesters + of German required)
and a program for students with less German. Please visit
the Global Engagement page and click on the tab “Calendars
and Pathways” to see all the options available to you: https://
global.undergrad.columbia.edu/program/bcgs
For additional information on the Berlin Consortium, see the
Study Abroad—Sponsored Programs section in this Bulletin,

or consult the program's office at uge@columbia.edu
(iuge@columbia.edu).
Study Abroad CoursesSummer Courses
Classes taken abroad through Columbia-led programs (i.e.,
those administered by Columbia’s Center for Undergraduate
Global Engagement and taught by Columbia instructors) are
treated as Columbia courses, equivalent to those taken on the
Morningside Heights campus. If they are not explicitly listed by
the department as fulfilling requirements in the major or minor
[or special program or concentration], the DUS will need to
confirm that they can be used toward requirements in the major/
minor.Summer courses at Columbia are offered through the School of
Professional Studies.
Classes taken abroad through other institutions and programs
are treated as transfer credit to Columbia, and are subject to the
same policies as other transfer courses. There will be a limit on
Courses taken in a Summer Term may be used toward
requirements for the major/minor only as articulated in
department/institute/center guidelines or by permission of the
Director(s) of Undergraduate Studies. More general policies
about Summer coursework can be found in the Academic
Regulations section of this Bulletin.
Core Curriculum Connections
Faculty and graduate instructors from the Department of
Germanic Languages regularly teach in the Core, usually
Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization.
347Germanic Languages
The Department of Germanic Languages also offers
several courses that build on the coursework in
Contemporary Civilization including “Marx, Nietzsche,
Freud” (GERM4670GU) and “Aesthetic Theory - Frankfurt
School” (CLGR 4210GU) and “Aesthetics and Philosophy of
History” (CLGR4250GU).
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Undergraduate Research in Courses
Beyond the wide-ranging language instruction, the department
offers courses that teach students critical theory and
interdisciplinary thinking that are applicable to many areas
of knowledge. Courses like “Literary Theory: Nietzsche-
Agamben” (CLGR4130GU) introduce students to theoretical
and interdisciplinary methods. “Advanced Topics” (UN3991)
introduces students to contemporary topics and scholarly
debates and is based on current research interests of faculty
members. Students are also given an opportunity to develop an
independent research project.
Students should consult with the Director of Undergraduate
Studies. Students can register for Directed Readings with a
faculty member.
Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
A senior thesis is not required for the major. Students interested
in a senior thesis or research project may do so through
independent study with a faculty member over one or two
semesters. Students should approach a faculty member at the end
of their junior or beginning of their senior year.
The Deutsches Haus Prize for Distinguished Undergraduate
Achievement is given to a graduating German major or minor
who has demonstrated excellence and promise in the field of
German Studies.
Other Important Information
Deutsches Haus
Deutsches Haus, 420 West 116th Street, provides a center for
German cultural activities on the Columbia campus. It sponsors
lectures, film series, and informal gatherings that enrich
the academic programs of the department. Frequent events
throughout the fall and spring terms offer students opportunities
to engage with current issues in the field and practice their
language skills. Twice a month during the semester, the
department offers “Kaffeestunde,” an open German conversation
hour for speakers at all proficiency levels. The department also
holds monthly Dutch and Yiddish Conversation hours.
Grading
Courses in which a grade of D has been received do not count
toward the major or concentration requirements.

Program Planning for all Students
Students who entered Columbia (as first-year students or
as transfer students) in or after Fall 2024 may select from a
curriculum of majors and minors. The requirements for the
Bachelor of Arts degree, and role of majors and minors in those
requirements, can be found in the Academic Requirements
section of the Bulletin dated the academic year when the student
matriculated at Columbia and the Bulletin dated the academic
year when the student was a sophomore and declared programs
of study.

Course Numbering Structure
The 1000 and 2000-level courses are typically language classes
including Elementary, Intermediate, and Conversation. At the
3000/4000-level, courses are either advanced language classes
and literature/culture classes. While many 3000/4000 courses are
taught in English, others are taught in the target language and
have language prerequisites or requirements.
Guidance for First-Year Students
Students who have had prior German instruction are required
to take the placement test, which is offered every semester.
Students may enroll in 3000 and 4000 level literature and culture
courses taught in English before or without completing the
language requirements.
Guidance for Transfer Students
When students transfer to Columbia from other institutions, their
coursework at their previous institution must first be considered
by their school in order to be evaluated for degree credit. Only
after that degree credit is confirmed, departments may consider
whether those courses can also be used to fulfill specific degree
requirements toward a major or minor [or special program or
concentration].
Undergraduate Programs of
Study
Major in German Literature and Cultural
History
The goal of the major is to provide students with reasonable
proficiency in reading a variety of literary, philosophical, and
historical texts in the original and, through this training, to
facilitate a critical understanding of modern German-speaking
cultures and societies. Students should plan their program of
study with the director of undergraduate studies as early as
possible. Competence in a second foreign language is strongly
recommended, especially for those students planning to attend
graduate school.
The major in German literature and cultural history requires a
minimum of 30 points, distributed as follows:
GERM UN2102
GERM UN3001
or GERM UN3002
INTERMEDIATE GERMAN II
ADVANCED GERMAN I (can
be waived and replaced by another
3000 level class upon consultation
with the DUS)

level offerings in German and Comparative Literature–
German in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate
Studies.
Intermediate German II (GERM UN 2102) can be counted
toward the required 30 points, but the total of points from
language courses should not be higher than six points.
Senior Thesis
A senior thesis is not required for the major. Students interested
in a senior thesis or research project may do so through
independent study with a faculty member over one or two
semesters.
349Germanic Languages
Major in Yiddish Studies
The program is designed as a combination of language and
content courses. First- and second-year Yiddish language
courses emphasize spoken and written communication, and
provide a basic introduction to Eastern European Jewish culture.
Goals include mastery of the structure of the language and
enough cultural understanding to interact comfortably with
native speakers.
After second-year Yiddish language courses are completed,
students should feel sufficiently comfortable to begin to
work with Yiddish literature in the original. Upper-level
undergraduate/graduate courses are designed to accommodate
students with a range of Yiddish language experience, and
intensive language summer study abroad, such as the Naomi
Prawer Kadar International Yiddish Summer Program (the
Yiddish Studies program at Columbia offers the fully-subsidized
Naomi Fellowship for students of Yiddish), or other academic
summer programs, is also encouraged for improvement in
language acquisition and comprehension.
The goal is to provide students with reasonable proficiency in
reading a variety of literary, philosophical, and historical texts
in the original and, through this training, to provide them with a
critical understanding of Yiddish-speaking culture and society.
The second pillar of the Yiddish program is an intimate exposure
to the literature and culture of the Yiddish-speaking Jewry.
That exposure is achieved through several courses in Yiddish
literature, which, although they may cover a variety of subjects
or proceed from a number of methodological and disciplinary
orientations, share a rigorous commitment to analyzing and
experiencing that literature within an overarching historical and
cultural framework.
These courses in Yiddish literature, culture and Jewish history
will provide students with a solid interdisciplinary foundation
in Yiddish studies. Inevitably and necessary, these courses,
whether taught in Yiddish, English, or in a combination of the
Yiddish text and English language instruction – cover the sweep
of Yiddish literary history from the early modern period to
today.
Students should plan their program of study with the director
of undergraduate studies as early as possible. There is a
prerequisite of two years of Yiddish, or equivalent to be
demonstrated through testing.
The Major in Yiddish Studies requires a minimum of 30 points,
distributed as follows:
1. Two courses of advanced language study (6 points); YIDD
UN3101, YIDD UN3102
2. Three courses in Yiddish literature (9 points); e.g. YIDD
UN3500, YIDD GU4420
3. At least one course related to a senior thesis (3 points);
4. Four related courses, at least one of which is in medieval
or modern Jewish history (12 points); e.g. HIST UN4604,
YIDD GU4113.
A senior thesis is required for the Major in Yiddish Studies.
Students interested in a senior thesis or research project may do
so through independent study with a faculty member over one or
two semesters. Students must conduct original research, some of
which must take place in the Yiddish language, and are required
to submit a culminating paper, of no less that 35 pages.
Elective courses:
Elective courses can be taken at Columbia as well as at affiliated
institutions such as the Jewish Theological Seminary, Barnard
College, New York University, etc. Columbia’s arrangements
with the joint degree appointing program at JTS, i.e. JTS and GS
Joint program with List College, offers students exposure to a
wide variety of courses on Yiddish and Yiddish-related topics
taught by experts in the field of Yiddish and comparative Jewish
literature.
Thanks to the consortial arrangements with other universities in
the New York area (Barnard, NYU, Yale, Penn, etc.) students
both in Columbia College and General Studies, can take
courses at these institutions for degree credit, which allows
for student exposure to experts in twentieth-century Soviet
Yiddish literature, Yiddish women’s writing, Yiddish literature
in Israel, and much more (Profs. Gennady Estraikh, Kathryn
Hellerstein , and Hannan Hever). These arrangements allow
students to have, if they so choose, an even broader intellectual
experience than the already broad interdisciplinary opportunities
available to them via the courses offered by the faculty on the
Interdisciplinary Committee on Yiddish at Columbia.
Language courses need to be taken at Columbia.
Honors options:
Departmental Honors in Yiddish Studies can be granted to
a total of 10% of the students graduating with the Major in
Yiddish Studies in a given year across both Columbia College
and General Studies.
Minor in German
The total number of courses required for the minor is 5
courses (= minimum of 15 points).
Pre-requisites:
The minor requires at least 4 semesters of German language (=
through Intermediate II), or equivalent proficiency determined
by placement test. However, students can count the second
semester of intermediate German (GERM UN2102) towards
their five courses and begin other coursework (in translation)
before completing the four semesters of language.
350Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Language/Literature and Culture distribution:
A maximum of 6 points can be fulfilled with upper-level
language courses (Intermediate II and/or Advanced). The
remaining credits (= at least three courses) need to be
3000/4000-level literature/culture courses.
The total number of courses required for the minor is 5 courses
(minimum of 15 points). Prerequisites: None. The second
semester of Contemporary Civilization is recommended but not
required. There is no German language requirement as part of
the minor. Classes will be taught in English.
Required Course:Requirements: Students have to take two of the following three
courses:
GERM UN3333 (Introduction to German Literature)1. CLGR4210GU: Aesthetic Theory - Frankfurt School
Course Description: Prerequisites: GERM UN2102 or
the equivalent. Examines short literary texts and various
methodological approaches to interpreting such texts in order to
establish a basic familiarity with the study of German literature
and culture.Critical theory was the central practice of the Frankfurt School.
Founded in Frankfurt in 1923 and later based at Columbia
University, this interdisciplinary institute influenced fields like
sociology, political science, film, cultural studies, media theory,
and comparative literature. The course begins by examining
the genealogy of the Frankfurt School in Marxism and its
critique of fascism and traces its afterlife in aesthetic theory,
deconstruction, and gender studies, as well as the specter of
“Cultural Marxism” recently floating around right-wing circles.
We read texts by key figures of the Frankfurt School such as
Theodor W. Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Herbert Marcuse and
Jürgen Habermas as well as works by adjacent figures like
Walter Benjamin, Hannah Arendt, and Siegfried Kracauer.
Recommended Electives:
1. One of the period survey courses in German literature and
culture
a. GERM UN3442 Survey of German Literature: 18th-Century
b. GERM UN3443 Survey of German Literature: 19th-Century
c. GERM UN3444: Survey of German Literature: 20th-Century
2. GERM UN3991: Advanced Topics in German Literature
Other electives:
The remaining courses can be chosen, in consultation with the
Director of Undergraduate Studies, from the department’s other
3000- or 4000-level offerings in German and Comparative
Literature-German (taught in German or English).
Sequencing:
Minor in German Thought and Critical
Theory
The minor enables students to gain a deeper knowledge of a
critical intellectual and philosophical tradition, which was first
established by Kant and then adapted by Marx, Nietzsche,
Freud, Arendt, and the Frankfurt School. In addition to
historicizing the contexts that allowed for the emergence of
this mode of critical thinking, the minor also trains students to
extend this critical awareness to new but equally contingent
circumstances that we encounter in our global presents and
futures. The minor draws on and strengthens crucial core
competencies of a Columbia undergraduate education, especially
critical thinking, written communication, global awareness, oral
communication, and research. Students expand their knowledge
of critical arguments by Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, and Arendt
whose texts they also read as part of Contemporary Civilization.
Offered in cooperation with the Philosophy Departments at
Barnard and Columbia, this interdisciplinary minor allows
students to explore various dimensions of critical theory
including literary theory, continental philosophy, aesthetics, and
political theory.
2. GERM4670GU: Marx, Nietzsche, Freud
Along with Darwin, Marx, Nietzsche and Freud have radically
altered what and how we know; about humans, language,
history, religion, things and life. Because their thought has
shaped our sense of ourselves so fundamentally, Michel
Foucault has referred to these three authors as discourse-
founders. As such they will be treated in this class. Special
attention will be paid to the affinities and competition among
their approaches. Secondary sources will be subject to short
presentations (in English) of those students capable of reading
German.
3. CLGR4250GU: Aesthetics and Philosophy of History (in
English)
This course offers an introduction to German intellectual history
by focusing on the key texts from the 18th and 19th century
concerned with the philosophy of art and the philosophy of
history. Instead of providing a general survey, this thematic
focus that isolates the relatively new philosophical subspecialties
allows for a careful tracing of a number of key problematics.
The texts chosen for discussion in many cases are engaged in
lively exchanges and controversies. Readings are apportioned
such that students can be expected to fully familiarize
themselves with the arguments of these texts and inhabit them.
Electives: In addition, students take elective courses to be
chosen from the following list of classes. They can also petition
for other elective courses to count toward the minor, dependent
on approval by the DUS of German.

II. As part of the New Media in Jewish Studies Collaborative,
this class will be using new media in order to explore and
research the fabulous world of Yiddish literature, language, and
culture, and to engage in project-oriented activities that will
result in creating lasting multi-media online presentations. In
addition to expanding the command of the language that has
been spoken by the Ashkenazi Jews for more than a millennium,
i.e. focusing on developing speaking, reading, writing and
listening skills, and on the acquisition of more advanced
grammatical concepts, students will also get some video and
film editing training, and tutorials on archival research. The class
will continue to read works of Yiddish literature in the original
and will venture outside of the classroom to explore the Yiddish
world today: through exciting field trips to Yiddish theater,
Yiddish-speaking neighborhoods, YIVO, Yiddish Farm, and
so on. And we will also have the Yiddish native-speaker guest
series. Welcome back to Yiddishland!

with an UNDED advisor at least twice, during the fall of their
junior year and the fall of their senior year.
The undergraduate open house is held in February of each
academic year. It serves as an opportunity for students to learn
more about the History program from the DUS, UA, current
students, and alumni.

The Study of History
The History undergraduate curriculum covers most areas of the
world and most periods of history. Our courses explore various
methodologies, a wide range of ways of writing history, and
different approaches to the past. We emphasize no one approach
to history and insist upon no single interpretive model. Thinking
historically is an analytical skill of increasing value in an epoch
dominated by short-term perspectives.
The History Department offers a major, concentration, and
minor in history. Each degree enables students to achieve a
deeper and broader knowledge of a particular field of history,
while also developing the kinds of analytical and writing skills
important in many areas of life. The heart of the undergraduate
major is the senior thesis seminar, a small-group course in which
students work closely with an individual faculty member on
some subject. Undergraduate majors are not required to write a
senior thesis, however in order to receive departmental honors a
senior thesis must be completed. Each year the department offers
3 to 4 sections of Senior Thesis Seminar and students have the
flexibility to work on any subject that they choose.
Student Advising
Consulting Advisers
The History Department does not assign individual advisors
providing the Undergraduate Education Committee (UNDED)
for student advising. The UNDED, which consists of full-time
faculty members, are ready to help undergraduates understand
degree requirements, choose a specialization, guide students
toward appropriate courses, and simply discuss students’
experiences. Students may see any member of UNDED for
advising concerns. UNDED advisors also approve a History
student’s Plan of Study, which serves as the course plan for
students and lists the courses required to earn a History degree.
UNDED advisors hold office hours during the fall and spring
terms and membership of UNDED changes from year to year,
therefore please consult the department’s website for an up-to-
History courses fall into two types, lectures and seminars.
Though almost all of these courses do not require placement
exams, some seminars might require an application to join.
LECTURES meet twice a week for 1 hour and 15 minutes each
session and have additional required discussion sections that
meet once a week. Lectures range from the very large (over
300 students) to the very small (fewer than 25). Most lecture
courses require a midterm and a final examination; many also
require written assignments and final papers. For identification
purposes, history lectures are numbered at the 1000 or 2000
level (exceptions exist for courses taught in the summer, which
are sometimes listed at the 3000 level).
SEMINARS are smaller, more intensive courses that explore
focused topics through concentrated reading in secondary
literature, primary-source research, or both. They meet once
a week for 1 hour and 50 minutes. The workload for seminars
is generally heavier than for lectures, with more reading and
more written work. Seminars normally do not have a final
examination but often require a substantial paper. In many cases,
admission to a seminar requires approval from the instructor and
can include an application. History seminars are numbered at the
3000-level (all undergraduate) or 4000-level (undergraduate and
graduate). Some summer courses listed at the 3000 level may be
lectures and do not qualify as seminars.

Study Abroad Courses
The History department allows up to 3 courses outside of
Columbia University to count towards the major (up to 2 for
concentrators and minors), to which no more than 2 may be
applied toward the specialization. These courses consist of
transfer courses and/or study abroad courses.
History majors, concentrators and minors may choose to study
abroad as part of their undergraduate education. This is typically
done during the junior year for one term. A period of study
overseas offers history students excellent opportunities to
develop language skills as well as begin research projects that
may be developed into a senior thesis. Members of UNDED
will be happy to discuss with students their plans and how they
fit both intellectual goals and program requirements. Please
note that courses are formally approved by the department
only after you have returned and a transfer credit request has
been submitted. Students who wish to apply study abroad
courses to the major, concentration or minor should submit a
transfer credit request to the History Department (undergraduate-
history@columbia.edu).
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Undergraduate Research in Courses
History students are encouraged to strengthen their analytical
and writing skills which can be achieved through seminars.
History seminars explore focused topics through concentrated
reading in secondary literature, primary-source research, or both.
The workload for seminars is generally heavier than lectures
with more reading and more written work. Seminars normally
do not have a final examination but often require a substantial
paper. It is recommended that students begin taking seminars
their second year and at the 3000-level. Seminars at the 4000-
level consist of both undergraduate and graduate students.
Some seminars have prerequisites, which are noted in the
directory course listing. In many cases, students must receive
permission from the instructor prior to registering for a seminar.
Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
History majors have the option of writing a senior thesis over
one or two terms. This process involves original research,
normally with extensive use of primary materials. The
department encourages students with a strong interest in a
particular subject to consider a thesis and strongly advises all
students considering an academic career to write one.
Students are advised to begin thinking about whether they
wish to write a thesis, and about possible topics by the start of
junior year. Applications to join the year-long Senior Thesis
Seminar are due during the spring semester of a student’s junior
357History
year. Students writing a senior thesis must take at least 1 HIST
seminar by the fall of their senior year.
Alternatively, students who wish to work with a member of the
department on an individual basis may register for a one or two-
term independent senior thesis section for 2-4 credits per term.
Students who pursue this option should identify an appropriate
supervisor (History Department faculty member) and submit
a short proposal, approved by the supervisor, to the History
Department before the beginning of the thesis term. Independent
theses cannot be considered for honors and prizes consideration.
Department Honors and Prizes
Department Honors
The Undergraduate Education Committee (UNDED) awards
departmental honors on the basis of a high major grade point
average (at least 3.6) as well as an excellent senior thesis.
Students must also have an overall GPA of at least 3.6. The
committee takes into account the depth and breadth of the
program of study for each honors candidate. Normally, no more
than 10% of graduating majors receive Departmental Honors.
Academic Prizes
Senior Thesis Seminar writers have the opportunity to submit
their thesis for prizes given by the History Department, the
College, and General Studies. Prizes not administered by the
department are also available and details can be found through
your school’s academic affairs office.

session and have additional required discussion sections that
meet once a week and are numbered at the 1000-level and 2000-
level below:
• UN 1xxx - Introductory Survey Lectures
• UN 2xxx - Undergraduate Lectures
Seminars are smaller, more intensive courses that explore
focused topics through concentrated reading in secondary
literature, primary-source research, or both. The workload
for seminars is generally heavier than for lectures, with more
reading and more written work often requiring a substantial
paper. Seminars are numbered at the 3000-level and 4000-level

Guidance for First-Year Students
Students interested in a History degree should first take a look
at the department’s Undergraduate Handbook which details the
requirements of the major, concentrator, and minor in History.
In regards to courses and where to begin, the History curriculum
does not have a set course plan or “one size fits all” for History
students. Every major, concentrator, and minor will have the
opportunity to choose a field to specialize in to which their
course plan will be created on a Plan of Study based on that
specialization.
What is recommended to all first-year students interested in
history is to begin with a lecture at the 1000 or 2000 level that
captures their interest. From there they proceed to a seminar
related to that initial lecture and/or more lectures as they begin
building History courses for their Plan of Study.
Guidance for Transfer Students
Students transferring into Columbia should first take a look at
the department’s Undergraduate Handbook which details the
requirements of the major, concentrator, and minor in History.
After familiarizing themselves with the History program,
transfer students should consider submitting a transfer credit
request for history courses taken at their previous institution. In
addition, transfer students should meet with an Undergraduate
Education Committee (UNDED) advisor to go over and create a
Plan of Study to set a course plan in place.
Undergraduate Programs of
Study
Required Coursework for all Programs
All History students are required to choose and complete a
“specialization”. The specialization is a set of courses on a
specific field, theme, or subject. In most cases, the regional
specialization must be bound by a time period; for example,
“20th Century U.S. History” as opposed to just “U.S. History”.
To determine which History courses fulfill a specialization,
students should consult an Undergraduate Education Committee
(UNDED) advisor.
Students interested in a thematic specialization (e.g.
Environmental History) should consult an Undergraduate
Education Committee (UNDED) advisor.
All program course plans are organized through a student’s Plan
of Study, which is approved by an UNDED advisor.
Major in History
The History major is an opportunity for students to pursue their
intellectual interests, whether in a specific or multiple fields
in history. Students will establish an understanding of various
methodologies and approaches to reading and writing history
and also acquire skills such as critical thinking, research and
analysis, synthesizing large amounts of information, and writing.
The total number of History courses required to complete the
major is 9, most of which will be 4-points, and are created
through a student’s Plan of Study. Courses eligible to count
toward the major are below:
• Courses in the History Departments of both Columbia and
Barnard (HIST and HIST BC)
• Cross-Listed courses for a specific term (found in the
Columbia College Bulletin)
• Transfer courses accepted through a transfer credit request.
• Graduate courses taught by History Department faculty
With advice and approval from the Undergraduate Education
Committee (UNDED), students will create a Plan of Study,
which serves as the course plan for their degree.
As mentioned, the History major requires 9 total courses listed
on a Plan of Study approved by an UNDED advisor. The Plan of
Study courses breakdown is below:
SPECIALIZATION COURSES are courses directly related
to a student’s chosen specialization. (4 specialization courses
required)
BREADTH COURSES are courses taken outside of a student’s
specialization. They are broken down into two categories: time
and space.
• Removed in Time: course covering a time period far
removed from their specialization. (1 removed-in-time course
required)
• Removed in Space: courses in regions removed from their
chosen specialization. (2 removed-in-space courses required)

361Science and Society
Science and Society
The Science and Society minor is an interdisciplinary collection
of courses for students who wish to explore critical approaches
to and societal implications of science, technology, health, and
environment. The aim of the minor is to equip students in all
fields, whether humanities, social sciences, or STEM disciplines,
to critically interact with both new developments and long
histories of science and technology, enabling them make sense
of and intervene on societal grand challenges on individual,
community, and global scales.
The Science and Society minor is informed by the existing
field of Science and Technology Studies (STS), an established
interdisciplinary field that leverages methods and theories from
the social sciences and humanities to interrogate the impacts not
only of science and technology on society and culture but also of
society and culture on science and technology.

The Study of Human Rights
Human rights are central to contemporary understandings of
justice and equality and have crucial bearing on the ability to
assess and respond to emerging technological, economic, social,
cultural, and political issues.
The Undergraduate Human Rights Program at the Institute for
the Study of Human Rights engages students in this dynamic
and evolving field and enhances their knowledge, skills, and
commitment to human rights. The program offers a major
and a minor in human rights (and a concentration for students
who entered Columbia prior to the 2024-25 academic year). It
provides students the opportunity to deepen their knowledge and
explore their interests in human rights outside the classroom,
and works to strengthen and support the undergraduate human

Student Advising
Consulting Advisers
Prior to each semester, students should submit a major, minor, or
concentration worksheet. These worksheets are also available on
the ISHR undergraduate program website. Students may also e-
mail uhrp@columbia.edu to set up an advising appointment.
Enrolling in Classes
Students are encouraged to take Introduction to Human Rights
(HRTS UN 3001 ) early in their studies, if possible.
We offer a selection of human rights courses at the 3000- and
4000-level. Courses offered by other schools or departments,
which are pre-approved for the degree can be found on our
undergraduate course list.
If you have questions about course approvals or enrollment in
HRTS classes, please email UHRP@columbia.edu.
Preparing for Graduate Study
Students interested in pursuing graduate human rights studies
may be interested in applying for the Human Rights Studies
B.A./M.A. option. Applicants should apply the semester before
the one in which they intend to begin taking courses that will
count toward the M.A. For information on how to apply for the
Human Rights Studies Master of Arts (HRSMA) program and
relevant deadlines, please visit this page. All students would
complete the 30 credit points and 2 Residence Units required of
the M.A. program, but the joint option allows students to receive
an M.A. one semester earlier than would normally be possible.
Please refer to the B.A./M.A. page of the website for additional
information.
Students are also encouraged to review the information below
pertaining to the Human Rights Research Award, the Senior
Thesis Track, and other Professional Development resources,
which may be of interest to those planning to pursue graduate
studies.
Departmental Honors and
Senior Thesis
Departmental Honors
To be eligible for departmental honors, a student must satisfy
all the requirements for the major, maintain a 3.6 GPA in the
major, maintain an overall GPA of 3.6, and complete a thesis
of sufficiently high quality to merit honors. A thesis is required
for all students who wish to be considered for honors, but
does not guarantee honors. Students who graduate in October,
February, or May of a given academic year are eligible for
honors consideration in May. Normally no more than 10%
of graduating majors receive departmental honors in a given
academic year.
Students interested in writing a thesis for honors consideration
complete a two semester course sequence during their final
year of study. In the fall, students take HRTS UN3994 Human
Rights Senior Seminar: Research Methods, which introduces
students to various research methods and guides them through
the proposal development process. In the spring, students take
HRTS UN3996 Human Rights Thesis Seminar. This course will
consist of group sessions, where students will present their work
and participate in discussions, as well as individual meetings
with their thesis supervisor, who is also the course instructor.
Students are encouraged to write a thesis, but they should not
do so solely to be eligible for honors consideration. Rather,
students should consider enrolling in the thesis seminar in order
to demonstrate their capacity to produce a work of original
research and develop more specialized knowledge of a human
rights issue. You can learn more about specific timelines for
363Human Rights
Thesis application at https://www.humanrightscolumbia.org/

Undergraduate Research Opportunities
Human Rights Research Award
In addition to the Senior Thesis Track, the ISHR Human Rights
Research Award provides students with an opportunity to gain
valuable research experience, while supporting the work of
Columbia faculty conducting human rights-related research.
Students who receive the Award are expected to complete
approximately 80-120 hours of research assistance during the
academic year. The research opportunities selected for each
academic year are circulated to students in the Fall semester.
ISHR will award one stipend per research opportunity in the
amount of $1,500. Priority will be given to HRSMA and UHRP
students. Please visit our financial resources page for this and
other opportunities.
Academic Prizes and Professional
Development
ISHR fosters undergraduate students’ academic and professional
development by awarding prizes and stipends, organizing events
and activities with human rights practitioners and experts, and
connecting students with resources related to the human rights
field. Specifics are available on our Professional Development
and Financial Resources page.

Guidance for Transfer Students
Transfer Credit/Study Abroad Credit
Human rights students may transfer a maximum of three courses
(nine Columbia-equivalent credits) towards the Major or one
course (three Columbia-equivalent credits) towards the Minor
for courses taken at another institution. This includes study
abroad credit and Advanced Placement courses. No more than
one AP course can be transferred towards the major or the
minor. Typically no more than one transfer course can count
toward the distributional, and the remainder would count for
the specialization. The application of transferred courses must
be approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies or the
undergraduate adviser.
Students wishing to count transfer courses toward the major or
the minor should email uhrp@columbia.edu with their Entrance/
Transfer Credit Report or a transcript, the syllabi of the courses
they want to count toward departmental requirements, and a
statement of how they want to apply the transfer credits to the
requirements.

Specialization Requirement **
Students fulfill the specialization requirement by focusing on
a particular discipline, taking four courses for a minimum of
12 credit points offered by a single department or institute.
* Please see the ISHR undergraduate course list for the current
list of courses that fulfill the distributional requirement of the
major.
**The goal of the specialization requirement is to equip students
with the tools of a specific discipline. Students should inform
the human rights program of their intended specialization
before taking courses to fulfill this requirement. As a general
rule, fields of study listed as academic programs on the
bulletin are approved for the specialization requirement
if a free-standing major is offered. Courses approved for
that major are generally approved for the human rights
specialization. However, language acquisition and studio
courses may not be taken to fulfill the specialization
requirement. Students are encouraged to take any core and/or
methodology courses required by a program when fulfilling
their specialization requirement. Students are also encouraged
to take courses within their chosen specialization that focus on
human rights issues, but the specialization requirement can be
fulfilled by taking any four courses within the same discipline.
For example, if a student's specialization is Political Science,
he or she can fulfill the specialization requirement by taking
any four POLS courses.

Columbia University unless expressly permitted by the Director
of Undergraduate Studies. Exceptions or substitutions permitted
by the Director of Undergraduate Studies should be confirmed in
writing by email to the student.
Advanced Placement
The department grants 3 credits for a score of 5 on the AP
Italian Language exam, which satisfies the foreign language
requirement. Credit is awarded upon successful completion of a
3000-level (or higher) course with a grade of B or higher. This
course must be for at least 3 points of credit and be taught in
Italian. Courses taught in English may not be used for language
AP credit. The department grants 0 credits for a score of 4
on the AP Italian Language exam, but the foreign language
requirement is satisfied.
Barnard College Courses
All relevant Barnard courses are treated as part of the available
curriculum and accepted in the Major and Minors. Students
• Intermediate: Alessandra Saggin, as2931@columbia.edu
367Italian
should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies on
which Barnard courses are considered relevant.
Transfer Courses
• When students transfer to Columbia from other institutions,
their coursework at their previous institution must first be
considered by their school in order to be evaluated for degree
credit (e.g., to confirm that the courses will count toward
the 124 points of credit that every student is required to
complete for the B.A. degree). Only after that degree credit is
confirmed, departments may consider whether those courses
can also be used to fulfill specific degree requirements
toward a major or minor.
• No more than three (3) courses toward the Italian Major may
be fulfilled with transfer credit; no more than one (1) course
toward the Minors.
• Students should contact the Director of Undergraduate
Studies to request review of transfer credit and submit the
syllabi of courses taken outside Columbia for consideration.
Study Abroad Courses
• Classes taken abroad through Columbia#led programs (i.e.,
those administered by Columbia’s Center for Undergraduate
Global Engagement and taught by Columbia instructors) are
treated as Columbia courses, equivalent to those taken on
the Morningside Heights campus. If they are not explicitly
listed by the department as fulfilling requirements in the
major or minor, the Director of Graduate Studies will need
to confirm that they can be used toward requirements in the
Major/Minors.
• Classes taken abroad through other institutions and programs
are treated as transfer credit to Columbia, and are subject
to the same policies as other transfer courses. There will be
a limit on the number of courses taken abroad that can be
applied to the Major/Minor, and they must be approved by
the Director of Undergraduate Studies.
Summer Courses
• Summer courses at Columbia are offered through the School
of Professional Studies. Courses taken in a Summer Term
may be used toward requirements for the Major/Minors only
as articulated in Department guidelines or by permission of
the Director of Undergraduate Studies. More general policies
about Summer coursework can be found in the Academic
Regulations section of this Bulletin.
• Beyond the Columbia Summer in Venice Program, for
students who stay in New York the Italian Department offers
courses in Elementary and Intermediate Italian during the
Summer.
Core Curriculum Connections
• Students may be interested in course offerings in this
department that can be taken in fulfillment of the Global
Core requirement and the Language requirement of the
Core Curriculum. See the list of approved courses for
the requirement on this page of the Bulletin that lists all
approved courses to see the list of courses in this department
that have been approved for the requirement.
• For students who would like to build on their experience
in Literature Humanities, the Italian Department offers
courses on Dante, who has been on the Literature Humanities
curriculum since its inception, and on Boccaccio. In addition,
the Department offers Mediterranean Humanities I & II, a
sequence of courses designed as the Global Core equivalent
of Literature Humanities.

• The National Italian Honor Society (GKA)Program Planning for all Students
Juniors and seniors (CC, GS, BC) who show superior scholastic
performance in the field of Italian language, literature, and
culture can be nominated as members of the National Italian
Honor Society (GKA). The Honor Society “encourages
college students to acquire a greater interest in, and a deeper
understanding of, Italian culture, art and history.” Juniors and
seniors with at least a B+ average in Italian who have taken
courses in culture and/or literature are eligible for membership.• Students who entered Columbia (as first#year students
or as transfer students) in or after Fall 2024 may select
from a curriculum of majors and minors. The requirements
for the Bachelor of Arts degree, and role of majors and
minors in those requirements, can be found in the Academic
Requirements section of the Bulletin dated the academic year
when the student matriculated at Columbia and the Bulletin
dated the academic year when the student was a sophomore
and declared programs of study.
In addition, the Society offers a $500 award to an essay
(2000-2500 words) written in Italian. Students must be seniors
completing an Italian Major or Minor in order to compete for the
essay award.
Other Important Information
• A wide range of cultural programs are sponsored by the
Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America, including
the activities of the Columbia Seminar on Modern Italian
Studies. These programs enrich the learning experience of
the students and offer opportunities to meet distinguished
Italian and Italian-American visitors to the University.
The Columbia Summer in Venice Program, housed in the Casa
Muraro, offers students the opportunity to immerse themselves
in the culture, history, and language of Venice on a six-week
summer program in the city. Students learn about the art,
literature, music, culture and society of Venice and the Veneto
region while also having the option to study and practice Italian.
The program is not geared toward any particular major (although
its courses count toward the Major and Minor in Italian, as well
as the Minor in Mediterranean Studies), and students with no
Italian language or art history background are eligible to apply.
Professors
• Students who entered Columbia in or before Fall 2023
may select from a curriculum of majors and minors and
concentrations. The requirements for the Bachelor of
Arts degree, and the role of majors and minors in those
requirements, can be found in the Academic Requirements
section of the Bulletin dated the academic year when the
student matriculated at Columbia and the Bulletin dated
the academic year when the student was a sophomore and
declared programs of study.
• The program of study is to be planned as early as possible
with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students are
advised to meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies
each semester in order to obtain program approval.
Course Numbering Structure
With the exception of conversation courses, Elementary
language classes are UN1XXX, Intermediate language classes
are UN2XXX, and Advanced language classes are UN3XXX.
(Conversation courses do not count toward the Major or the
Minor and all start with UN1XXX, regardless of level.) Any
literature, culture or history courses at the 4XXX level start
with GU and are suitable for undergraduate students as well as
graduate students. Undergraduate literature, culture or history
courses start with UN3XXXX.

Guidance for First-Year Students
• For students pursuing an Italian Major or Minor the
prerequisite is Intermediate II or a demonstrated equivalent
level of knowledge of the Italian language.
• For students who have no prior knowledge of Italian, the
required sequence is Elementary Italian I & II (UN1101-
UN1102) or Intensive Elementary Italian (UN1121) and
Intermediate Italian I & II (UN2101-UN2102) or Intensive
Intermediate Italian (UN2121).
• Students with prior knowledge of Italian must take the Italian
placement exam before declaring the Italian Major or Minor.
Students may be exempted from the language requirement in
Italian in one of three ways: a) by presenting a score of 4 or
5 on the Advanced Placement Italian Exam; b) by presenting
a score of 780 or above on the SAT Subject Test in Italian;
c) by obtaining a satisfactory score on the department’s
placement examination
Guidance for Transfer Students
Transfer students pursuing an Italian Major or Minor may need
to enroll in Intensive Italian courses (ITAL UN1121 Intensive
Elementary Italian; ITAL UN2121 Intensive Intermediate
Italian) in order to fulfill the language prerequisite in time.
Double-counting Guidelines for All Students
• If a student decides to pursue more than one program of
study, the student’s declared programs of study may not both
be governed by the same department. For example, a student
may not declare a Major or a Minor in Italian and a Minor in
Mediterranean Studies.
• Students may double-count courses taken to fulfill the
Language requirement and the Global Core requirement
toward programs of Study (Italian Major and Minor, and
Minor in Mediterranean Studies). Note: The shared courses
of the Core Curriculum—specifically, Art Humanities,
Contemporary Civilization, Frontiers of Science, Literature
Humanities, Music Humanities, and University Writing—
may not be double-counted with any major or minor.
• In addition to double-counting any courses described above,
students pursuing two programs of study may double-count
a maximum of two classes of any type, if the classes are
approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies to fulfill
a requirement for each program of study.
Ages to the present. Through a cluster of courses from the Italian
Department, as well as other Humanities and Social Science
departments and approved study abroad programs, the Major
in Italian seeks to enhance students’ knowledge of Italy in a
globalized world.
The learning goals of the Major in Italian are therefore: 1) to
give students an advanced knowledge of the Italian language;
and 2) to help students gain a deeper understanding of the
literature, culture and history of Italy.
Design
The Major in Italian requires a minimum of 30 points (10
courses).
Prerequisites
The 30 required points (10 courses) do not include the necessary
prerequisites, i.e. Intermediate II or a demonstrated equivalent
level of knowledge of the Italian language.
For students who have no prior knowledge of Italian, the
required sequence to cover the prerequisite is Elementary
Italian I & II (UN1101-UN1102) and Intermediate Italian
I & II (UN2101-UN2102), or Intensive Elementary
Italian (ITAL UN1121) and Intensive Intermediate Italian
(ITAL UN2121), or a combination between a regular sequence
and an intensive course. Therefore, for a student who must
take all coursework at Columbia (i.e., who does not enter
Columbia with advanced placement) the overall number of
courses required to pursue an Italian Major is 14 (46 points,
16 of which count also toward the Language requirement).
However, the overall number of courses required to pursue
an Italian Major becomes either 12 if the student chooses the
Intensive Elementary & Intermediate Italian option (42 points,
12 of which count also toward the Language requirement),
or 13 if the student chooses a combination between a regular
sequence and an intensive course (44 points, 14 of which count
also toward the Language requirement).
However, students with prior knowledge of Italian may be
exempted from the prerequisites in one of three ways: a) by
presenting a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement Italian
Exam; b) by presenting a score of 780 or above on the SAT
Subject Test in Italian; c) by obtaining a satisfactory score on the
department’s placement examination. Therefore, for them the
overall number of courses required to pursue an Italian Major is
10 (30 points).

and
• Italian Literature or Cultural Studies
Minor in Italian
The Minor in Italian is a smaller and more flexible course of
study aiming to introduce students to Italian language, literature,
history, and culture from the Middle Ages to the present day.
Through a cluster of courses from the Italian Department, as
well as from other Humanities and Social Science departments
and approved study abroad programs, the Minor in Italian seeks
to enhance students’ knowledge of Italy in a globalized world.
The learning goals of the Minor in Italian are therefore: 1)
to give students an advanced-level knowledge of the Italian
language; and 2) to help students gain a deeper understanding of
the literature, culture, and history of Italy.
Design
Introduction to Italian Literature I and II (ITAL UN3333-4)
provides an overview of major authors and works in the Italian
literary tradition from the Middle Ages to the present. Taught in
Italian. (This sequence does not need to be taken in progressive
order.)
or
Italian Cultural Studies I and II (ITAL GU4502-3). An
interdisciplinary investigation into Italian culture and society
from national unification in 1860 to the present. Taught in
English. (This sequence does not need to be taken in progressive
order.)
Elective Courses
With the permission of the Director of Undergraduate
Studies, Italian majors select six additional courses from the
department’s 3000- or 4000-level offerings or from other
Humanities and Social Science departments with a focus on
Italian culture, society and history from the Middle Ages to
the present (at least 50% of the material of courses offered
outside of the Italian Department should focus on Italian
topics). Students who have taken courses in Italian Literature,
Italian History, and/or Italian Culture while abroad should
consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to determine
if the courses may be applicable to the Major.
Highly motivated students have the opportunity to pursue a
senior thesis under the guidance of a faculty adviser in an area
of Italian literature or culture of their choosing. The senior thesis
tutorial (ITAL UN3993 Senior Thesis/Tutorial) will count for 3
points.
Majors in Italian are required to take at least two of the six
elective courses from the Italian Department’s offerings, which
are not Language Through Content courses. The remaining
The Minor in Italian requires a minimum of 15 points (5
courses).
Prerequisites
The 15 required points (5 courses) do not include the necessary
prerequisites, i.e., Intermediate II or a demonstrated equivalent
level of knowledge of the Italian language.
For students who have no prior knowledge of Italian, the
required sequence to cover the prerequisite is Elementary
Italian I & II (UN1101-UN1102) and Intermediate Italian
I & II (UN2101-UN2102), or Intensive Elementary
Italian (ITAL UN1121) and Intensive Intermediate Italian
(ITAL UN2121), or a combination between a regular sequence
and an intensive course. Therefore, for a student who must take
all coursework at Columbia (i.e., who does not enter Columbia
with advanced placement) the overall number of courses
required to pursue an Italian Minor is 9 (31 points, 16 of which
count also toward the Language requirement). However, the
overall number of courses required to pursue an Italian Major
becomes either 7 if the student chooses the Intensive Elementary
& Intermediate Italian option (27 points, 12 of which count also
toward the Language requirement), or 8 if the student chooses
a combination between a regular sequence and an intensive
course (29 points, 14 of which count also toward the Language
requirement)
However, students with prior knowledge of Italian may be
exempted from the prerequisites in one of three ways: a) by
presenting a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement Italian
Exam; b) by presenting a score of 780 or above on the SAT
Subject Test in Italian; c) by obtaining a satisfactory score on the
department’s placement examination. Therefore, for them the
371Italian
overall number of courses required to pursue an Italian Minor is
5 (15 points).
Required Courses
Italian minors are required to take one of the following course
sequences: a) Advanced Italian Language; b) Italian Literature;
c) Italian Cultural Studies:
• Advanced Italian Language (this sequence should be taken in
progressive order)
in Italian are required to take at least one of the three elective
courses within the Italian Department’s offerings which are not
Language Through Content Courses, chosen in consultation with
the Director of Undergraduate Studies.
Students pursuing an Italian Minor should download and use the
relevant worksheet.
Minor in Mediterranean Studies
The Minor in Mediterranean Studies is a flexible
course of study intended to introduce students to the
various facets of the Mediterranean Sea from a cross-
disciplinary perspective. Drawing on courses from within
the Italian Department as well as departments and units
across the university, the program seeks to enhance
students’ understanding of this culturally diverse and
politically important region of the world. It offers them the
opportunity to explore the connections among the peoples
living in this geographic area over a broad chronological
span—from prehistoric times to the present—and to focus
on issues that go beyond specific nations, cultures, and
states, such as migration, cultural transfers, diversity,
multilingualism, translation, border crossing, empires and
colonialism, circulation of goods and ideas, islands, the
physical environment, and resource management. The
learning goals of the Minor in Mediterranean Studies are
therefore: 1) to give students vital tools for thinking about
the world from the perspective of an interconnected sea
space and through a comparative and transnational point of
view; and 2) to help students gain a deeper understanding
of the history, and culture of the Mediterranean through
an interdisciplinary path of study. Upon completion of the
Minor, students should be able to have a basic knowledge
of the ways in which the Mediterranean Sea has served over
time as a medium of contact, exchange, and interaction
among multiple societies, nations, religions, and languages,
and use this knowledge to reconsider global relations in the
world today.
• Advanced Italian (ITAL UN3335). Advanced reading, writing,
speaking with emphasis on authentic cultural materials. Topic
and semester themes vary. Taught in Italian.
• Italian Language through Content. Course offerings under this
category include courses such as: Italian through Cinema (ITAL

Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites.
Required Courses
Elective Courses
In addition to one of the above sequences, students pursuing
the Minor in Italian will be asked to select three courses from
the department’s 3000- or 4000-level offerings or from other
Humanities and Social Science departments with a focus on
Italian culture, society and history from the Middle Ages to the
present (at least 50% of the material of courses offered outside
of the Italian Department should focus on Italian topics). Minors
Minors in Mediterranean Studies are required to take the
following two-semester sequence (not necessarily taken in
progressive order). This sequence also fulfills the Global
Core requirement:
• Mediterranean Humanities I (CLIA GU4499)
Course description: Mediterranean Humanities I explores
the literatures of the Mediterranean from the late Middle
372Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Ages to the Early Nineteenth Century. We will read
Boccaccio, and Cervantes, as well as Ottoman poetry,
Iberian Muslim apocalyptic literature, and the Eurasian
connected versions of the One Thousand and One Nights.
We will dive into the travel of texts and people, stories
and storytellers across the shores of the Middle Sea. Based
on the reading of literary texts (love poetry, short stories,
theater, and travel literature), as well as letters, biographies,
memoirs, and other ego-documents produced and consumed
in the Early Modern Mediterranean, we will discuss big
themes such as Orientalism, estrangement, forced mobility,
connectivity, multiculturalism and the clash of civilizations.
Also, following in the footsteps of Fernand Braudel and
Erich Auerbach, we will reflect on the Mediterranean in the
age of the first globalization as a laboratory of the modern
global world and world literature.
• Mediterranean Humanities II (CLIA GU4500)
Course description: What is the Mediterranean and how
was it constructed and canonized as a space of civilization?
A highly multicultural, multilingual area whose people
represent a broad array of religious, ethnic, social and
political differences, the Mediterranean has been seen as
the cradle of western civilization, but also as a dividing
border and a unifying confluence zone: as a sea of pleasure
and a sea of death. The course aims to enhance students’
understanding of the multiple ways this body of water
has been imagined by the people who lived or traveled
across its shores. By exploring major works of theory,
literature and cinema since 1800, it encourages students to
engage critically with a number of questions (nationalism
vs cosmopolitanism, South/North and East/West divides,
tourism, exile and migration, colonialism and orientalism,
borders and divided societies) and to ‘read’ the sea through
different viewpoints. In the final analysis, Med Hum II is
meant to engage the question of what it means to stand on
watery grounds and to view the world through a constantly
shifting lens.
Elective Courses
In addition to these two Global Core courses, students
pursuing the Minor in Mediterranean Studies will
take three elective courses. One should be from the
Mediterranean offerings of the Italian Department, while
the other two can be from other departments and units
across the university. The approved courses should adopt
a Mediterranean transnational, comparative or regional
perspective, engage with issues on a cross-Mediterranean
scale (such as migration, cultural transfers, translation,
borders, contacts and conflicts, empires and colonialism,
islands, circulation of goods and ideas, common
environmental and resource management questions),
or place their particular topics within a Mediterranean
framework (at least 50% of the course material should
fulfill these requirements). Students pursuing a Minor
in Mediterranean Studies should download and use the
relevant worksheet.
For students who entered
Columbia in or before the
2023-24 academic year
Concentrations are available to students who entered Columbia
in or before Fall 2023. The requirements for the Bachelor of Arts
degree, and the role of the concentration in those requirements,
can be found in the Academic Requirements section of the
Bulletin dated the academic year when the student matriculated
at Columbia and the Bulletin dated the academic year when
the student was a sophomore and declared programs of study.
Concentrations are not available to students who entered
Columbia in or after Fall 2024.
Concentration in Italian
The Concentration in Italian requires a minimum of 24 points (8
courses).
Prerequisites
The 24 required points (8 courses) do not include the necessary
prerequisites, i.e., Intermediate II or a demonstrated equivalent
level of knowledge of the Italian language.
For students who have no prior knowledge of Italian, the
required sequence to cover the prerequisite is Elementary
Italian I & II (UN1101-UN1102) and Intermediate Italian
I & II (UN2101-UN2102), or Intensive Elementary
Italian (ITAL UN1121) and Intensive Intermediate Italian
(ITAL UN2121), or a combination between a regular sequence
and an intensive course. Therefore, for a student who must take
all coursework at Columbia (i.e., who does not enter Columbia
with advanced placement) the overall number of courses
required to pursue an Italian Concentration is 12 (40 points,
16 of which count also toward the Language requirement).
However, the overall number of courses required to pursue
an Italian Major becomes either 10 if the student chooses the
Intensive Elementary & Intermediate Italian option (36 points,
12 of which count also toward the Language requirement),
or 11 if the student chooses a combination between a regular
sequence and an intensive course (38 points, 14 of which count
also toward the Language requirement).
However, students with prior knowledge of Italian may be
exempted from the prerequisites in one of three ways: a) by
presenting a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement Italian
Exam; b) by presenting a score of 780 or above on the SAT
Subject Test in Italian; c) by obtaining a satisfactory score on
the department’s placement examination. Therefore, for them
the overall number of courses required to pursue an Italian
Concentration is 6 (24 points).
Required Courses

Starting in Fall '24, the Special Concentration in Jazz Studies
is no longer available for students to declare. Students who
declared the Special Concentration in Jazz Studies in Spring
'24 or prior are allowed to complete this concentration.
The Special Concentration in Jazz Studies is an interdisciplinary
liberal arts course of study that uses jazz music—and the jazz
culture from which the music emanated—as a prism through
which to study jazz culture during what might be termed the
long jazz century, the Sprawling 20's. The curriculum in this
field guides students in developing a firm grounding in the
traditions and aesthetic motives of jazz music, viewed through
the perspectives of music history and ethnomusicology as well
as literary theory and cultural studies.
The program also explores in depth the development of jazz-
oriented art works in the music’s sister arts—literature, dance,
painting, photography, and film. While a U.S. focus is highly
appropriate, considering the many ways in which jazz is a
definitive music of this nation, students also explore jazz’s
geographical history beyond these shorelines, including
complex, ongoing interactions with Africa, the Caribbean,
Europe, and Asia.
While there are some fields where the fit with jazz studies is
very obvious—music, American studies, African-American
studies, English, comparative literature, and history—
students can major in any field whatsoever. Is there a jazz or
improvisatory philosophy? What might be its relation to studies
of aesthetics or American pragmatism? And what are jazz’s
implications for the student of law? How does one protect
the intellectual property rights of an improvised jazz solo?
What about business? What economic and political forces have
shaped jazz? Who buys jazz? What is its audience? What is a
jazz painting? A jazz novel? What is jazz poetry? What is jazz
dance? What is a jazz film? What are the sources and meanings
of art? What work does the music do for the whole community?
Along with problems of musical history, form, and definition,
our courses explore jazz as a culture. Students not only study
individual jazz artists but also explore the immeasurably
variegated worlds through which such artists moved, and which
they helped to shape. As cultural historians-in-training—focused
on questions of nationality, race, sexuality, gender, economics,
and politics—students explore the extraordinarily complicated
terrains of the New Orleans of Bunk Johnson, for example, or
the Baltimore of Billie Holiday (born in Philadelphia, reared in
Baltimore). They explore such artists’ other geographical travels.
What did their images, including mistaken conceptions of who
they were, tell us about the cultures that mythologized them?
How did these jazz musicians influence not only musicians but
other artists of their era and milieu: the poets and novelists,
painters and sculptors, photographers and filmmakers, dancers
and choreographers who regularly heard them play and often
shared with them a sense of common project?
One thinks of Tito Puente, working with singers and dancers
at the Palladium; Jackson Pollack dancing to the music as he
spun drips of paints on canvasses placed on the studio floor;
Langston Hughes writing detailed instructions to the musicians
he hoped would accompany performance of his poetry; Romare
Bearden’s beautifully turned stage and costume designs for
Alvin Ailey and Dianne McIntyre, whose improvisatory jazz
dance workshop was called Sound in Motion; the drummer
Jo Jones in an interview naming as key influences a series of
tap dancers he admired; Stanley Crouch, stirring in his high-
powered essays in a room where jazz drums stand at the center,
the old dream-kit inspiration; Ralph Ellison, who kept in touch
with his beginnings as a musician in Oklahoma City through
hour-long conversations with his childhood friend, the singer
Jimmy Rushing; Toni Morrison reading her magical prose to
improvisations by Max Roach and the dancer Bill T. Jones;
and the pianist Jason Moran playing at the Studio Museum in
Harlem, where he introduced his group as including Beauford
Delany, whose paintings hung on the wall near the bandstand—
vigorous all and recall across the art forms.
Perhaps above all, the Special Concentration in Jazz Studies is
designed to prepare students to be well-prepared and flexible
improvisers in a universe of change and possibility.

Jewish Studies
The academic discipline of Jewish Studies is an interdisciplinary
field centered on the analysis and investigation of Jewish
history, religion, cultures, languages, and literatures. The
discipline ranges from the study of Jews and Judaism in
antiquity to the present day. It explores Judaism not only as a
religion, but also as a civilization and culture.
Jewish Studies students continue on to graduate study in a
variety of fields. Please reach out to our Program Director, Dr.
Isabelle Levy, at icl2001@columbia.edu for any advising needs.

minor. Several Barnard courses are cross-listed with Jewish
Studies. If you have any questions about which classes apply
towards the Minor in Jewish Studies, please contact our Program
Director, Dr. Isabelle Levy, at icl2001@columbia.edu.
A minor in Jewish Studies is available for undergraduates
and allows students to draw upon classes in a wide range of
departments across the University, including, but not limited to,
History; Sociology; Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African
Studies; Germanic Languages; Music; Film; and Religion. The
requirements for the minor are designed to provide students
with the interdisciplinary knowledge necessary to pursue Jewish
Studies both broadly and deeply.Transfer Courses
The roots of Judaism lie deeper than one region, gender,
language, or culture, and by studying the interconnectedness
of these areas, the depth of understanding across a range of
spheres and disciplines greatly increases. The minor in Jewish
Studies provides students with an opportunity to expand their
knowledge according to their particular interests and can
likewise complement an array of majors across academic
disciplines.Study Abroad Courses
Students wishing to complete a minor in Jewish Studies work
with Program Director Dr. Isabelle Levy to decide upon course
selection and sequencing. The program office provides and
keeps on record a planning form to track the fulfillment of
requirements for the minor.Some summer courses may be applied toward the minor. If you

Undergraduate Programs of
Study
Minor in Jewish Studies
In addition to the requirements of the minor, students must
complete a major.
Students are required to complete five Jewish Studies courses
comprising between 15 to 20 points, depending on the number
of points of each course. Introductory language study that
complements the student’s Jewish Studies coursework may
constitute one of these courses. Languages may include (but
are not limited to) Arabic, Aramaic, French, Greek, Hebrew,
Russian, and Yiddish and should be relevant to the student’s
other coursework in Jewish Studies. Language courses at the
advanced level that are conducted in the language and that
require reading and writing in the language may count as an
additional course.
Jewish Studies students may choose to take Global Core
courses that contain Jewish Studies content. As is College
policy, two courses that fulfill either the Global Core or the
science requirement can be double-counted toward the Core
requirements and toward one of your programs of study.

The Study of Latin American &
Caribbean StudiesMany of the interdisciplinary courses for the program may
partially satisfy Global core requirements. Not all courses are
offered every semester, but there are ample opportunities to take
these courses:
The major in Latin American and Caribbean Studies stresses
knowledge of a dynamic, historically deep and extensive
region, but it also focuses on social, political, and cultural
phenomena that transcend physical boundaries. The major thus
reflects multidisciplinary dialogues that are transnational yet
remain anchored in the common historical experience of Latin
American societies. Thanks to the broad range of courses on
Latin America offered in different departments of instruction
and centers at Columbia, the major provides a multidisciplinary
training on politics, history, culture, economy and society.
The Institute of Latin American Studies coordinates the major
and offers access to research support, study abroad options, and
linkages and credits toward the M.A. program in Latin American
and Caribbean studies.

The Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures (LAIC)
at Columbia, located in the Casa Hispánica, has long enjoyed an
international reputation as a center for Hispanic and Lusophone
studies. The department provides linguistic preparation in
Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan, and offers a flexible program
to study manifestations of the Hispanic and Lusophone worlds
in all historical periods—from the medieval to the globalized
present—and in a variety of cultural contexts: the Iberian
Peninsula, Latin America, the former colonies of Portugal, and
the United States.
Students can enter the program at any level of linguistic and
cultural preparedness. The department offers a placement exam
to determine the level at which students may either begin or
continue study. Majors and concentrators in Hispanic studies
and Portuguese studies are typically double majors who bring
insights and methods from fields such as history, political
science, women's studies, anthropology, economics, Latino
studies, Latin American studies, etc., which fosters engaging
discussions.
Academic Programs
The department offers two majors. The major in Hispanic
studies gives students a well-rounded preparation in the history
and culture of the Hispanic world. The second option, a major
in Hispanic studies with specialization, allows students to
study the Hispanic world through a number of fields, among
them Latin American studies, gender studies, political science,
economics, history, and sociology. The department also offers
two concentrations: Hispanic studies and Portuguese studies.
The language and major programs have also been designed in
close consultation and cooperation with Barnard's Department
of Spanish and Latin American Cultures. All courses taken
in one program may be used to fulfill the requirements of the
other. Hence, Columbia and Barnard students may move freely
between departments of both institutions for courses that best fit
their intellectual interests and schedules.
Advanced Placement
The department grants 3 credits for a score of 5 on the AP
Spanish Language exam, which satisfies the foreign language
requirement. Credit is awarded upon successful completion of a
3300-level (or higher) course with a grade of B or higher. This
course must be for at least 3 points of credit and be taught in
Spanish. Courses taught in English may not be used for language
AP credit.
The department grants 0 credits for a score of 4 on the AP
Spanish Language exam, but the foreign language requirement is
satisfied.
The department grants 3 credits for a score of 5 on the AP
Spanish Literature exam, which satisfies the foreign language
requirement. Credit is awarded upon successful completion of a
3300-level (or higher) course with a grade of B or higher. This
course must be for at least 3 points of credit and be taught in
Spanish. Courses taught in English may not be used for language
AP credit.
The department grants 0 credits for a score of 4 on the AP
Spanish Literature exam, but the foreign language requirement is
satisfied.
Study Abroad
The department strongly recommends that all Hispanic and
Portuguese studies majors/concentrators study abroad. Most
courses taken abroad can be used to fulfill the requirements for
the major and concentration, and with adequate planning, even
some of the requirements for a second major or concentration.
A maximum of four (4) courses taken abroad may be applied to
the major, and a maximum of three (3) to the concentration in
Hispanic or Portuguese studies.
All students are strongly advised to take either SPAN UN3349
HISPANIC CULTURES I (SP) or SPAN UN3350 HISPANIC
CULTURES II (SP) before studying abroad. Actual or potential
majors and concentrators in Hispanic or Portuguese studies
should seek tentative approval of their programs from the
director of undergraduate studies before their departure.
The Hispanic Institute
The department hosts the Hispanic Institute at Columbia.
Founded in 1920 as the Instituto de las Españas, the Institute
sponsors and disseminates research on Hispanic and Luso-
385Latin American and Iberian Cultures
Brazilian culture. Since 1934, the Institute has published the
Revista Hispánica Moderna, a distinguished journal in Hispanic
criticism and theory.
In Fulfillment of the Language
Requirement
For students with no knowledge of Spanish, Portuguese,
or Catalan, at least four terms of the language are required:
UN1101-UN1102 (or UN1120) and UN2101-UN2102 (or
UN2120). All courses must be taken for a letter grade to
fulfill the language requirement.
Students with prior knowledge of Spanish who plan to continue
studying Spanish are required to take the department’s on-line
placement examination before registering for courses. Students
with prior knowledge of Portuguese or Catalan should speak
with the director of language programs.
Students may be exempted from the language requirement in one
of four ways:
1. Present a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Spanish Language or
Spanish Literature Exams. Students who receive a score of
5 in either exam are awarded 3 AP credits upon successful
completion of a 3300-level (or above) course with a grade of
B or higher. AP credit is not granted for a score of 4.
2. Present a score of 780 or above on the SAT Subject
Test. Students with a score lower than 780 should take
the department's on-line placement exam and follow the
placement advice received.
3. Present a score of a 7, 6, or 5 on the International
Baccalaureate Higher Level Exam in Spanish.
4. Obtain a score of 625 or higher on ithe department's Spanish
as a Second Language Placement Exam. If the score on
the online exam qualifies a student for exemption from the
language requirement, they are required to take a second
in-person version of the online placement exam during
orientation (for entering students) or during the semester (for
continuing students). Please check our Department’s website
for information about scheduling the second in-person exam
for possible exemption..
Departmental Honors
Beginning in Spring 2015, the department put in place a new
timeline and training program for juniors, to assist students with
planning and completing the Honors Thesis during their senior
year. The Honors Thesis is an excellent option for any student
interested in pursuing a Master's degree or Ph.D.; but, above
all, it is a highly formative research and writing experience—
one that can bear unexpected fruits toward any path the student
decides to take in the future.
All students pursuing a major through the department may apply
to write an Honors Thesis. The department envisions the thesis
as an intellectually challenging and rewarding experience that
crowns four years of undergraduate studies with an original
contribution in the field chosen by the student.
The department supports students in shaping their research topic
and provides frequent advising throughout the research and
writing process. The timeline is as follows:
• During the junior year, students take into consideration the
possibility of writing an Honors Thesis in the following year.
The topic of the Honors Thesis may likely originate in an
advanced course taken during the junior year; students may
also choose to develop ideas discussed or papers written in
courses taken in previous years. Juniors schedule a meeting
(or, if the student is studying abroad, a Skype conversation)
with the director of undergraduate studies to discuss their
proposed topic and faculty adviser.
• By May 15, juniors who have decided to write an Honors
Thesis in their senior year send a formal proposal to the
director of undergraduate studies, which includes:
• A title and a one-page abstract;
• The name of the proposed faculty adviser;
• An application for departmental partial funding support
(for those who would like to pursue research during the
summer).
• By May 30, the Honors Thesis committee reviews the
proposals and informs the students of its decision.
• In the fall of the senior year:
• Seniors selected to write the Honors Thesis enroll in a
Supervised Individual Research section (SPAN UN3997
or SPAN UN3998) with their faculty adviser and write
the Honors Thesis during the entire senior year under the
direction of their adviser. For the purposes of the major,
this independent study counts as a 3-point course towards
elective courses.
• Faculty advisers organize Honors Thesis Workshops to
discuss students' ongoing projects and provide advising
on research tools, methodological and theoretical frames,
and overall writing process.
• In the fall of the senior year, students enroll in a Senior
Seminar.
• By April 15 of the senior year, students complete and submit
a PDF of the Honors Thesis via email for consideration
towards departmental honors and prizes.
To be considered for departmental honors, a student must write
an Honors Thesis and maintain a GPA of at least 3.6 in major
courses. Normally no more than 10% of graduating majors
receive departmental honors in a given academic year.
Undergraduate Prizes
The faculty awards an undergraduate prize every year:
Susan Huntington Vernon Prize
Established in 1941 by a member of the noted family of New
York Hispanophiles, it is given to the Columbia College senior

The Study of Linguistics
In any discussion of linguistics, in popular or academic contexts,
the first question is always, what is linguistics, after all? This is
remarkable. Language informs most of our mental and cultural
activity, and linguistics is just the study of language.
The significance of linguistics in the context of the liberal
arts education is twofold. On the one hand, linguistics is a
highly developed field of knowledge whose achievements,
challenges, and problems constitute an integral part of the
modern world of ideas. On the other, understanding the inner
properties of language as a complex mechanism and awareness
of the extensive tools of its description developed by linguistics
provides a crucial background for a variety of disciplines whose
subject involves language, such as analytical philosophy,
anthropology, folklore, sociology, psychology, computer
science, archeology, classic philology, and literary theory.
Our programs of study are designed to acquaint students
with the theoretical ideas, conceptual apparatus, and research
techniques involved in the study of language in all its variety and
uses.

Preparing for Graduate Study
Columbia’s linguists have distinguished themselves with awards
and plans after graduation, such as Fulbright Fellowships in
Germany, Georgia, and Taiwan, graduate study at the University
of Hawaii at Manoa, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, and
CUNY Graduate Center. Linguistics is also a natural background
for studying law, and our students have entered such law schools
as Harvard, UCLA, and NYU.
Students interested in pursuing a graduate program in linguistics
should consult the Linguistics DUS for advice.

Undergraduate Programs of
Study
Major in Linguistics
Linguistics, especially since the 1960s, has become a highly
multifarious and interdisciplinary field of inquiry. This requires
that a major acquaint students with a number of subfields, all
of which are crucial to understanding what modern linguistic
analysis is about (and foster interdisciplinary inquiry as well).
To wit, the person with a basic foundation in what constitutes
linguistic study in our times, including training for graduate
study if desired, understands:
a)
the basics of grammatical analysis in terms of sounds and
sentence structure
b)
how languages change over time
c)
the mechanics of how languages express meaning and
implication
d)
the details and nuances of how language is used in social
space
e)
the ways and extent to which the world's 7000 languages
differ from one another
To this end, the major requirements – totaling 38 points – are as
follows:
1. LING UN3101 INTRODUCTION TO LINGUISTICS (3pts.)
2. LING GU4376 PHONETICS # PHONOLOGY (3pts.)
Prospective majors or minors should contact the Linguistics

7. Language requirement: Two semesters of an intermediate-
level language sequence (8 points). The language must differ
from that used to fulfill the core foreign language requirement.
The language taken can be ancient (e.g., Latin, Sanskrit, or
Ancient Greek) or modern but should neither be the student’s
native or semi-native language nor belong to one of the major
groups of modern European languages (i.e., neither Romance
nor Germanic—thus, not French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese,
Catalan, German, or Dutch). Students must actually take the
courses in question; testing out of the linguistics language
requirement is not allowed.
Minor in Linguistics
The linguistics minor is designed to acquaint students with a
scientific approach to language in all of its variety and uses. The
minor draws students from diverse disciplines and career paths
who share a common interest in language. Linguistic training
can be particularly valuable for students majoring in language-
related fields such as those in the cognitive sciences (computer
science, philosophy, anthropology, psychology, neuroscience,
393Linguistics
music), language studies, and human rights. A background in
linguistics can also be an asset for students pursuing careers in
law, language technologies, education, publishing, or speech
and hearing sciences. Many of our students are drawn to the
field because they are speakers—or advocates for speakers—
of smaller or endangered languages, and they want to learn how
to document and describe such languages or help develop and
advance technologies for them.
Our program offers students the flexibility to tailor the minor to
their specific needs and interests. Students may choose courses
that will enhance their primary area of study, or they may
explore linguistics as a secondary field of study independent of
their major.
The minor in linguistics consists of five courses (16 points):
1) Three courses in linguistics (i.e., offered in the Linguistics
Program). The choice of courses will depend on the student’s
interests. We strongly recommend—but do not require—that
students begin the minor with Ling UN3101: Introduction to
Linguistics.
Our current course offerings are as follows, organized by
subarea:
a) Language structure: The basics of linguistic analysis
LING UN3101: Introduction to Linguistics
LING GU4376: Phonetics & Phonology
LING GU4903: Syntax
LING GU4XXX: Semantics & Pragmatics (new course to be
offered in Spring 2025)
b) Language and society: How language is used in social space
e) Language change: how languages change over time
ENGL GU4901: History of the English Language
LING GU4108: Language History
2) One elective course, either a) in linguistics from the list above
or b) in a related field, chosen with approval from the Director
of Undergraduate Studies. Pre-approved elective courses for the

The major in mathematics is an introduction to some of the
highlights of the development of theoretical mathematics
over the past four hundred years from a modern perspective.
This study is also applied to many problems, both internal to
mathematics and arising in other disciplines such as physics,
cryptography, and finance.
Majors begin by taking either Honors mathematics or the
calculus sequence. Students who do not take MATH UN1207
HONORS MATHEMATICS A and MATH UN1208 HONORS
MATHEMATICS B normally take MATH UN2010 LINEAR
ALGEBRA in the second year. Following this, majors begin to
learn some aspects of the main branches of modern mathematics:
algebra, analysis, and geometry; as well as some of their
subdivisions and hybrids (e.g., number theory, differential
geometry, and complex analysis). As the courses become more
advanced, they also become more theoretical and proof-oriented
and less computational.
Aside from the courses offered by the Mathematics Department,
cognate courses in areas such as astronomy, chemistry, physics,
probability, logic, economics, and computer science can be
used toward the major. A cognate course must be a 2000-
level (or higher) course and must be approved by the director
of undergraduate studies. In general, a course not taught
by the Mathematics Department is a cognate course for the
mathematics major if either (a) it has at least two semesters of
calculus as a stated prerequisite, or (b) the subject matter in
the course is mathematics beyond an elementary level, such
as PHIL UN3411 SYMBOLIC LOGIC, in the Philosophy
Department, or COMS W3203 DISCRETE MATHEMATICS,
in the Computer Science Department. A list of pre-approved
cognate courses can be found under the major requirements.
Another requirement for majors is participation in an
undergraduate seminar, usually in the junior or senior year.
Applied math majors must take the undergraduate applied math
seminar sequence in both the junior and senior year. In these
seminars, students gain experience in learning an advanced
topic and lecturing on it. In order to be eligible for departmental
honors, majors must write a senior thesis.

Enrolling in Classes
Most undergraduate level courses in Mathematics can be
taken once the prerequisite courses have been completed. Any
exceptions to waive a prerequisite requirement must be obtained
by writing to the Director of Undergraduate Studies.
Students who wish to register for a section of either Supervised
Readings and/or Senior Thesis must first identify a faculty
sponsor, determine a suitable topic, and obtain written
permission from the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Refer to
the Undergraduate Research and Senior Thesis section, below.
Preparing for Graduate Study
Departmental advisors can offer advice about and help with
graduate school applications. The Mathematics department also
runs a Master’s degree program in mathematical finance and a
Ph.D. program in mathematics.

Students can receive credit for only one calculus sequence.
Other college level courses taken during high school may
substitute for course prerequisites pending the approval of the
Director of Undergraduate Studies, but will not confer credits.
Barnard College Courses
Any course offered by the Mathematics@Barnard department
will count towards degree requirements.
Transfer Courses
Courses taken at other colleges or universities may be evaluated
for transfer credit. A maximum of 16 transfer credits may be
granted. A maximum of 6 transfer credits may be counted
towards minor requirements.
• Course equivalency requests for any Calculus level course,
Linear Algebra, or Ordinary Differential Equations must be
submitted to the Calculus Director for evaluation.
• Course equivalency requests for any other mathematics
course must be submitted to the Director of Undergraduate
Studies for evaluation.
Study Abroad Courses
Although study abroad is not an integral part of your studies
in mathematics, it can provide you with exposure to a different
culture and a different educational system, and, as such, can be
very fulfilling. You may also want to participate in the Budapest
Mathematical Seminar or similar programs in your junior year.
Keep in mind, however, that study abroad requires careful
planning. If you are seriously considering studying abroad, you
should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies as
early in your program as possible in order to plan your major
accordingly and to incorporate study abroad courses that are
compatible with your major in mathematics.
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Undergraduate Research in Courses
MATH UN3901 Supervised Readings I (fall term only)
MATH UN3902 Supervised Readings II (spring term only)
Prerequisites: The written permission of the faculty member
who agrees to act as sponsor (sponsorship limited to full-time
instructors on the staff list), as well as the permission of the
Director of Undergraduate Studies. The written permission must
be deposited with the Director of Undergraduate Studies before
registration is completed.
Guided reading and study in mathematics. A student who wishes
to undertake individual study under this program must present
a specific project to a member of the staff and secure his or
her willingness to act as sponsor. Written reports and periodic
conferences with the instructor. Supervising Readings do NOT
count towards major requirements, with the exception of an
advanced written approval by the Director of Undergraduate
Studies.
Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
A Senior Thesis in Mathematics is an original presentation of
a subject in pure or applied mathematics from sources in the
published literature. The thesis must demonstrate significant
independent work of the author. A thesis is expected to be
between 20 and 50 pages with complete references and must
have a substantial expository component to be well received.
A student who is interested in writing a senior thesis needs to
identify a faculty member in the Department of Mathematics
as an advisor, determine an appropriate topic, and receive the
written approval from the faculty advisor and the Director of
Undergraduate Studies. The research of the thesis is conducted
primarily during the fall term and the final paper is submitted to
the Director of Undergraduate Studies by the end of March.
Students must register for MATH UN3994 SENIOR THESIS IN
MATHEMATICS I (4 credits) in the fall semester of their senior
year. An optional continuation course MATH UN3995 SENIOR
THESIS IN MATHEMATICS II (2 credits) is available during
the spring. The second term of this sequence may not be taken
without the first. Registration for the spring continuation course
has no impact on the timeline or outcome of the final paper.
Sections of Senior Thesis in Mathematics I and II do NOT count
towards the major requirements, unless prior written approval is
obtained from the Director of Undergraduate Studies.
398Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Undergraduate Research Outside of Courses
The department runs several undergraduate research programs
aimed at math majors. Opportunities are available during the
academic year and summer terms.
The Undergraduate Mathematics Society is the department’s
undergraduate club. Detailed information on membership,
Society-sponsored seminars and activities, and archival
resources are available on the Society’s Web site. The
department also sponsors workshops and weekly seminars in
mathematics, and posts information about special lectures,
conferences, and seminars at nearby schools.
In addition, the Association for Women in Mathematics
Columbia Chapter connects students and professors interested
in mathematics at Columbia University and Barnard College as
part of a broader effort to encourage women and girls to study
and to have active careers in the mathematical sciences, and to
promote equal opportunity for and the equal treatment of women
and girls in the STEM fields.
Department Honors and Prizes
Department Honors
To be recommended to the College Committee on Honors,
Awards, and Prizes, which makes the final decisions on
all honors’ recipients, you must have a GPA of 3.63 in the
major and have completed a senior thesis of merit. For more
information on researching and writing the senior thesis and
on departmental honors, you should consult with the Director
of Undergraduate Studies. Normally no more than 10% of
graduating majors receive departmental honors in a given
academic year.
Academic Prizes
Putnam Exam
The Putnam exam is a nationwide competitive exam
administered each year on the first Saturday in December. A
faculty member conducts coaching sessions for students who are
interested in competing.
Columbia Prizes
Several prizes for excellence in mathematics are awarded each

Guidance for Undergraduate
Students in Mathematics
Program Planning for all
Students
Placement in the Calculus Sequences
Calculus I
Students who have essentially mastered a precalculus course and
those who have a score of 3 or less on an Advanced Placement
(AP) exam (either AB or BC) should begin their study of
calculus with MATH UN1101 CALCULUS I.
Calculus II and III
Students with a score of 4 or 5 on the AB exam, 4 on the
BC exam, or those with no AP score but with a grade of
A in a full year of high school calculus may begin with
either MATH UN1102 CALCULUS II or MATH UN1201
CALCULUS III. Note that such students who decide to start
with Calculus III may still need to take Calculus II since it is
a requirement or prerequisite for other courses. In particular,
they MUST take Calculus II before going on to MATH UN1202
CALCULUS IV. Students with a score of 5 on the BC exam
may begin with Calculus III and do not need to take Calculus II.
Those with a score of 4 or 5 on the AB exam or 4 on the BC
exam may receive 3 points of AP credit upon completion of
Grading
No course with a grade of D or lower can count toward the
major, interdepartmental major, minor, or concentration.
Double Counting
Students who are doing a double major should review the
College Bulletin's policy on Double Counting Courses towards
Requirements. In general, courses in the Calculus sequence
may be counted towards both majors, with up to two additional
MATH UN2xxx or higher level courses at the discretion of all
approving departments. Students pursuing a minor may double
count at most one additional MATH UN2xxx or higher level
course.
Planning Forms
Planning forms for all programs are available on our website.
These forms should be completed and approved by a department
adviser early in the semester of the expected graduation date.
Course Numbering
Structure
• 1000-2000 Level courses are intended to be introductory
courses (such as the Calculus sequence and Linear Algebra).
• 3000-4000 Level courses cover more advanced mathematics,
as well as supervised readings, undergraduate seminars, and
senior theses.
400Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
• 5000 Level courses are Master’s level courses.
• 6000 Level and above are PhD level courses.
Guidance for First-Year
Students
The systematic study of mathematics begins with one of
the following three alternative calculus and linear algebra
sequences:
MATH UN1101
& MATH UN1102
& MATH UN1201
& MATH UN1202
& MATH UN2010
OR

and HONORS MATHEMATICS
A
and HONORS MATHEMATICS
B
Credit is allowed for only one calculus and linear algebra
sequence.
Calculus I, II is a standard course in single-variable differential
and integral calculus; Calculus III, IV is a standard course in
multivariable differential and integral calculus; Accelerated
Multivariable Calculus is an accelerated course in multivariable
differential and integral calculus.
While Calculus II is no longer a prerequisite for Calculus III,
students are strongly urged to take it before taking Calculus III.
In particular, students thinking of majoring or concentrating in
mathematics or one of the joint majors involving mathematics
should take Calculus II before taking Calculus III. Note that
Calculus II is a prerequisite for Accelerated Multivariable
Calculus, and both Calculus II and Calculus III are prerequisites
for Calculus IV.
The third sequence, Honors Mathematics A/B, is for
exceptionally well-qualified students who have strong
Advanced Placement scores. It covers multivariable calculus
(MATH UN1201 CALCULUS III - MATH UN1202
CALCULUS IV) and linear algebra (MATH UN2010 LINEAR
ALGEBRA), with an emphasis on theory.
Guidance for Transfer
Students
Consideration for AP, IB and transfer credit is as follows:
Equivalent to MATH UN1101 Calculus I:
• A score of 4 on the Calculus BC Advanced Placement exam.
• A score of 4 or 5 on the Calculus AB Advanced Placement
exam.
• A score of 6 on the IB Mathematics: analysis and approaches
HL exam (2021 or later) or a score of 6 on the IB HL
Mathematics or Further Mathematics exams (2020 or
earlier).
• A score of 6 or 7 on the IB Mathematics: applications and
interpretation HL exam (2021 or later) or a score of 6 or 7 on
the IB SL Mathematics exam (2020 or earlier). This does not
include the IB “Mathematical Studies SL” exam.
• An A on the A-Level Mathematics exam or a B in A-Level
Further Mathematics exam in the U.K.
• A grade of A in a full year of high school calculus.
Equivalent to MATH 1101 Calculus I and MATH 1102 Calculus
II:
• A score of 5 on the Calculus BC Advanced Placement.
• A score of 7 on the IB Mathematics: analysis and approaches
HL exam (2021 or later) or a score of 7 on the IB HL
Mathematics or Further Mathematics exams (2020 or
earlier).
• An A on the A-Level Further Mathematics exam in the U.K.

Minor in Mathematics
The Minor in Mathematics aims to provide students with a solid
foundation of mathematical concepts. The program focuses on
essential coursework, including multivariable calculus and linear
algebra.
The minor functions as a complement to a number of closely
related majors, including physics, economics, and computer
science. Designed for accessibility, the minor emphasizes
foundational understanding rather than proof-based courses,
distinguishing it from the comprehensive Mathematics major.
Students in economics, computer science, statistics, physics, and
similar natural science programs such as biology and climate
science may be particularly interested in the minor. However,
its versatile skillset extends beyond these disciplines. Students
in language programs, art, and other humanities can also benefit
from the minor's quantitative proficiency, enhancing their
studies and future career prospects.
Students start with the minor requirements, e.g. with advanced
placement sufficient to start the Multivariable Calculus/Linear
Algebra component. Upon completion of the minor, students
will have acquired the skills and knowledge to carry out basic
and advanced computations, formulate and solve problems, both
internal to mathematics and arising from real world applications.
The minor consists of 15-17 points, as follows:
1. Multivariable calculus
2. Linear Algebra
3. Three approved elective courses (at least 9 points), two
of which must be 2000+ level courses offered by the
Mathematics department. The third course may either be
an additional course in Math, or selected from a list of
approved cognate courses1. Only one Undergraduate Seminar
in Mathematics (MATH UN3951 UNDERGRADUATE
SEMINARS I or MATH UN3952 UNDERGRADUATE
SEMINARS II) may count towards the minor requirements.

Minor in Mathematical
Probability
Probability Theory is a core mathematical subject with deep
connections to a wide variety of disciplines. Many fundamental
probabilistic concepts and problems stem from such fruitful
interactions, from material sciences (e.g. percolation) to social
sciences and computer science (e.g. random networks).The
Minor in Mathematical Probability is a focused minor aiming
at providing students majoring in these disciplines with a solid
mathematical foundation organized around the probabilistic
concepts pertinent to their main program of study. The
transversal nature of probability both in science at large, and
in terms of university structure, is underlined by the option
of satisfying some core and elective requirements in other
departments, such as Statistics and Industrial Engineering and
Operation Research.
The minor naturally complements programs of study in natural
and social sciences. As a focused minor, it also provides students
with precise guidance on choices of coursework with direct
relevance to and synergy with their major.
Students start with the minor requirements, e.g. with advanced
placement sufficient to start the Multivariable Calculus/Linear
Algebra component. Upon completion of the minor, students
will have acquired core mathematical skillsets motivated and
illustrated by interactions with other disciplines, organized
around theoretical and applied probability. The specialized
structure and designation of the minor may also benefit career
and professional development.
The minor consists of 15-17 points, as follows:
1. Multivariable calculus
2. Linear Algebra
3. Probability Theory
4. Two approved elective courses (at least 6 points), at least one
of which is an approved course offered by the Mathematics
Department. The second course may either be an additional

The undergraduate program in Middle Eastern, South Asian,
and African studies (MESAAS) offers students the opportunity
to study in depth the cultures, ideas, histories, and politics of
several overlapping world regions. The program emphasizes
a close engagement with intellectual traditions, creative
movements, and political debates, drawing on a wide variety
of historical and contemporary sources in literature, religion,
political thought, law, the visual and performing arts, and new
media. Courses also examine the historical and cultural contexts
in which these traditions and debates have been produced.
Majors and Concentrations
Majors develop two closely related skills. The first is linguistic
expertise. A minimum of two years of course work in one
language is required, and further work (including intensive
summer language study) is greatly encouraged, because the aim
is to study a cultural field through its own texts and discourses.
The Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African
Studies offers courses in Arabic, Persian, Ottoman, Turkish,
Hebrew, Armenian, Sanskrit, Hindi/Urdu, Tamil, Swahili and
Wolof.
The second skill is learning how to think and write about
complex cultural formations, drawing on a variety of methods
and disciplinary approaches. The approaches vary according
to the faculty members' expertise, incorporating methods from
relevant fields in the humanities and social sciences, such as
literary criticism, film studies, cultural studies, political theory,
and intellectual history.
The only difference between the MESAAS major and the
concentration is that the latter does not require language
proficiency.

Guidelines for all Middle
Eastern, South Asian, and
African Studies Majors and
Concentrators
Introduction to MESAAS
Majors and concentrators begin their work with an introductory
course that emphasizes a particular area (the Middle East,
South Asia, or Africa). For instance, students interested in the
Middle East would take MDES UN1003 Premodern Islamic
Worlds. Students keen on learning more about South Asia would
take ASCM UN2357 INTRO TO INDIAN CIVILIZATION,
HSME UN3810 History of South Asia I: al-Hind to Hindustan,
or HIST W3811 South Asia II: Empire and Its Aftermath.
The introductory course generally recommended for students
interested in Africa is MDES UN2030 Major Debates in the
Study of Africa.
Required Core Courses
All majors must take two additional core courses. The first is a
small seminar in which they explore some of the classic texts
of the region, either AHUM UN1399 COLLOQUIUM ON
MAJOR TEXTS: MIDDLE EAST/INDIA (for those focusing on
the Middle East and South Asia) or AFCV UN1020 AFRICAN
CIVILIZATION (for those focusing on Africa).
With this background, students are ready to take MDES UN3000
THEORY AND CULTURE generally in the junior or senior
year. This course examines critical approaches to the study of
In Fulfillment of the Language Requirement
(for Majors)
Enrollment in language courses is in some cases determined
by placement exams. For more information, see Languages on
the departmental website and, if necessary, consult the relevant
Coordinator listed on that page. The website includes separate
pages for each language, describing the program of instruction,
courses for heritage speakers, summer language programs, and
more. Language courses must be taken for a letter grade. Pass/D/
Fail or Registration credit (R) is not permitted. Those seeking to
waive a language requirement must take a proficiency test.
Students who enter with language proficiency at only the
second-year level must complete one additional year of language
study and one additional MESAAS course. When students enter
with language proficiency at the third year level (or in cases
where only two years of a particular language are offered in
MESAAS), they must substitute three additional MESAAS
courses.
Advising
Newly declared majors and concentrators should meet with the
director of undergraduate studies in order to plan a program of
study. The goal is to strike a balance between courses that help
a student achieve depth in a particular area/discipline and those
that foster a wider perspective.
Although students are encouraged to approach faculty in the
department based on their specific interests, the director of
undergraduate studies functions as an ad hoc adviser for all
entering students, addressing issues of course requirements,
credit, approval for courses in other departments or schools,
study abroad, and, eventually, honors requirements (including
the senior thesis). Students should not hesitate to contact the
director of undergraduate studies to set up an appointment.
Grading
Courses in which the grade of D has been received do not count
toward the major or concentration requirements, nor do those
413Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies
taken Pass/D/Fail, except for the first course taken toward the
major or concentration.
Honors Program/Senior Thesis
Students may also wish to write a thesis. While not required
for graduation, the thesis enables a student to be considered for
departmental honors. It is advisable to begin planning for the
thesis during the student's junior year. Interested students should
attend the relevant information sessions and identify a potential
faculty adviser.
All students who wish to write a thesis must enroll in
MDES UN3960 HONORS THESIS SEMINAR PART 1, a full
year course consisting of a 1-point segment in the Fall semester
and a 3-point segment in the Spring semester. Students work
closely with their peers in a supportive environment to produce
a substantial piece of research (in the range of 40 pages). The
primary intellectual guidance is provided by the faculty adviser,
whereas the director of undergraduate studies and the honors
seminar teaching assistant oversee the general development
of the project. Every year in April, MESAAS hosts a senior
colloquium in which students present their research. For more
information on the honors program, see Frequently Asked
Questions on the departmental website.
For additional guidelines, see Departmental Honors as outlined
in the Academic Honors, Prizes, and Fellowships section of the
Columbia College Bulletin.
Major in Middle Eastern,
South Asian, and African
Studies
Students should obtain a Major Declaration form from their
advising dean and bring it to the director of undergraduate
studies for approval. The director of undergraduate studies meets
with students as necessary in order to establish and approve their
individual programs of study. The requirements for the major are
as follows:
Select a one-term introductory culture course, to be approved
by the director of undergraduate studies
AHUM UN1399
COLLOQUIUM ON MAJOR
TEXTS: MIDDLE EAST/INDIA
MDES UN3000
THEORY AND CULTURE
Select two years of a language regularly taught in the
department, or substitutional courses for students who test
out of this requirement with the approval of the director of
undergraduate studies
Select 15 points of coursework, which may include up to six
points from other departments, selected in consultation with
the director of undergraduate studies
The MESAAS Major and its ‘tracks’
Students majoring in MESAAS are studying the languages,
and central cultural and political aspects of the societies of the
Middle East, South Asia, and Africa, in past and present. This
can be done either with a focus on one of these three regions, i.e.
the ‘African Studies’, the ‘South Asian Studies’, or the ‘Middle
Eastern Studies’ track, or a comparative perspective on them, the
‘combined track’.
The coursework for each of those ‘tracks’ is composed of the
same five elements: 1. an approved Introductory course; 2. a
seminar on texts from the region; 3. 'Theory and Culture'; 4. five
approved elective courses; 5. the regional language requirement.
Note that some MESAAS courses are already comparative by
design and connect more than one region: for example, Societies
and Cultures Across the Indian Ocean, or Postcolonial Thought,
or courses on Persianate culture that include North India, or
Middle East courses that include North Africa. These may
satisfy requirements for more than one track, subject to approval
by the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS).
African Studies
1. MDES UN3130 Major Debates in the Study of Africa or
another approved introductory lecture course.
2. CC1020 African Civilization
3. MDES UN3000 Theory and Culture
4. Five additional courses on Africa, such as: South African
Literature and Culture: Apartheid and After; East Africa and
the Swahili Coast; or Pan Africanism (see the Courses page
for more options). You may include up to two courses from
other departments, in fields such as African history, politics, and
philosophy, the anthropology of Africa, and African art, subject
to the approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies. For a
listing of courses in other departments, see here.
5. Language: A minimum of two years of course work in
Swahili, Wolof, Arabic, Pulaar, or another African language. See
the MESAAS language programs here. Those already fluent in
an African language may substitute other courses—see FAQ.
Not required for the concentration.
Middle Eastern Studies
1. MDES UN1003 Premodern Islamic Worlds or another
approved introductory lecture course.
2. Asian Humanities UN1399 Major Texts: Middle East/India
3. MDES UN3000 Theory and Culture

Self-Narratives; Central Questions in Islamic Law, Palestinian-
Israeli Politics and Society, or Epics and Empires (see the
Courses page for more options). You may include up to two
courses from other departments, in fields such as Middle Eastern
history, politics, and anthropology, or Islamic art, subject to the
approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Find a list of
Middle East courses in other departments here.
5. Language: A minimum of two years of coursework

The Study of Music
The music Major, Minor in Music and SEAS Music Minor
provide aspiring music scholars and/or musicians with a wide
range of ways to think about music (theoretical, historical,
cultural, compositional and performance-related) and to
concentrate on the aspects of music that most interest them—
from popular to world music to computer music. Our faculty
engage in cultural studies (i.e. Ethnomusicology) and with
current literary theory, connect with faculty of other departments
(i.e. English, Philosophy, and Psychology), and are on the
cutting edge of technological change. Students who have a
passion for music and who have already developed basic skills
in areas including performance, music history, composition or
ethnography, should consider a major or minor in music.
Music Major & Minors
The Department of Music at Columbia University and Barnard
College currently offers undergraduate courses and programs of
study (Major in Music, Minor in Music and SEAS Music Minor)
for the four following schools: Columbia College, Barnard
College, General Studies and the School of Engineering and
Applied Sciences. Starting in the 2024 - 2025 academic year, the
Concentration in Music will begin to be phased out.
Music Performance Program
The Music Performance Program (MPP) is a division of
the Department of Music which supports music making of
the highest caliber, by creating learning and performance
opportunities for undergraduate students, regardless of their
academic major. While we do not offer degrees in music
performance, we provide a high-quality offering to student
musicians from across Columbia University that includes a
wide array of for-credit Classical, Jazz, Pop/Contemporary and
World Music ensembles and lessons in addition to the Columbia
University Orchestra. The Minor in Music, new in the 2024 -
2025 academic year, offers a Pathway in Performance.
For information on auditions, registration and other aspects
of performance not included below, please contact contact
Magdalena Stern-Baczewska, Director of the Music
Performance Program or visit mpp.music.columbia.edu
Students with questions about the Columbia-Juilliard
programs should consult Special Programs in this Bulletin or
mpp.music.columbia.edu/content/columbia-juilliard-program
Lessons
Individual instrument lessons listed under Courses of
Instruction are 6 hours per semester and are 1 credit courses.
Voice lessons at Barnard College are 12 hours per semester
and are 2 credit courses. There is a $300 lesson fee per
semester for each instrumental lesson course (note that
Columbia College, General Studies & SEAS students who
receive institutional need based grants from Columbia will
receive a credit for the music lesson fees as part of their financial
aid package) and $500 per semester for each Barnard voice
lesson course. Auditions are only offered in the fall semester and
courses are a one year commitment. Lessons are graded as pass/
fail only.
Ensembles
Participation in the following ensembles is open to all members
of the University community. Students who wish to receive
course credit may register for 1 point per semester for these
courses as listed. Ensembles receive letter grades only.
See Music Performance Program website for audition and
activity information about all of the below.
MasterClass
Performance Seminar MasterClass (MPP UN1601) is open
to classical musicians of any instrument(s) with the highest
commitment to performance. Students are admitted via live
audition during the first week of classes in the Fall. Each week,
two students perform repertoire of their choice for the class
and receive feedback from everyone present. The discussions,
moderated by the director of the Music Performance Program,
Dr. Magdalena Stern-Baczewska, are designed to provide
constructive criticism to the performers and to pose questions
related to performance from the perspectives of musical
interpretation, career management, professional collaboration,
and pedagogy.
Practice Rooms
Please see Practice Rooms and Policies for the most up to date
information.
Departmental Honors
For departmental honors, see the Director of Undergraduate
Studies during the first week of the first semester of senior year.

The Study of Philosophy
Students interested in philosophy may pursue a major
either in philosophy or in economics-philosophy. Because
philosophy treats issues fundamental to both the sciences and
the humanities, students are also welcome to combine their
philosophy major with work in other fields. Before declaring
a major in philosophy or economics-philosophy, and before
deciding to combine philosophy with another discipline, students
should meet with the director of undergraduate studies to
formulate the program best for them.
Philosophy majors are given a foundation in logic and
philosophical methodology, and are asked to confront
fundamental questions in the main areas of philosophy:
epistemology and metaphysics, ethics and political philosophy,
philosophy of mind and language, and history of philosophy.
The department requires that all majors take at least one
seminar (PHIL UN3912), designed to allow students to focus
on particular philosophical issues or texts in greater depth.
Outstanding seniors may also pursue their own philosophical
project in a senior thesis.
Over and above the courses required of all majors, there is
room for considerable flexibility. Through an appropriate
choice of electives from among the department’s offerings
(and from related courses in other departments), there are
special opportunities for focusing more intensively on one or
two subfields of philosophy, e.g., logic and the philosophy
of mathematics, philosophy of science, ethics and political
philosophy, or the history of philosophy. Students should consult
with the director of undergraduate studies on how best to pursue
such programs.
The Study of Economics-
Philosophy
The Joint Major in Economics and Philosophy is an
interdisciplinary one which, while introducing students to the
basic methodologies of economics and philosophy, stresses areas
of particular concern to both. These include subjects such as
rationality and decision making, justice and well-being, freedom
and collective choice, and the nature of empirical scientific
theories.
There are two advisers for the Joint Major, one in the
Department of Economics and one in the Department of
Philosophy. Please note that the economics adviser can advise
only on the economics requirements and the philosophy adviser
can advise only on the philosophy requirements.
Prospective majors are strongly advised to discuss the major
early in their sophomore year. Each major is expected to meet
with the departmental advisers in the middle of their junior year
and at the beginning of their senior year.

Consulting Advisers
• Students with questions regarding the Philosophy major or
concentration should contact the DUS by email to set up an
appointment.
• Students interested in joining the Philosophy
Undergraduate listserv can email Haley Donovan at
hmd2151@columbia.edu.
• Undergraduate Open Houses, Information Events, and
Welcome Events will be advertised through our listserv and
Department website.
Enrolling in Classes
• Please note some courses require professor permission to
join. If this is the case, students should email the professor as
early as possible to join the course.
Preparing for Graduate Study
• Students interested in pursuing graduate studies should
consult with their advisers or the DUS.
Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
• Coursework in fulfillment of a major or minor in Philosophy
must be taken at Columbia University unless explicitly
noted here and/or expressly permitted by the Director
of Undergraduate Studies. Exceptions or substitutions
422Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
permitted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies should
be confirmed in writing by email to the student.
Advanced Placement
• The Department of Philosophy does not accept any advanced
placement credit toward courses in the curriculum.
Barnard College Courses
• The Columbia and Barnard Philosophy Departments function
together as a unit. The courses specifically designed for
Barnard students (first-year and senior seminars) do not
count towards the Columbia major or concentration. But all
other courses in the Columbia-Barnard joint curriculum do
count for the major or concentration, regardless of whether
the instructor is associated with Barnard or Columbia.
Transfer Courses
• Courses taken at other institutions may count only after
review and approval by the DUS (a written record of
approval must be submitted to 708 Philosophy by the student
or DUS). No more than 5 courses taken elsewhere may be
applied to the major, and no more than 4 to the concentration.
Study Abroad Courses
• Classes taken abroad through Columbia-led programs (i.e.,
those administered by Columbia’s Center for Undergraduate
Global Engagement and taught by Columbia instructors) are
treated as Columbia courses, equivalent to those taken on the
Morningside Heights campus. If they are not explicitly listed
by the department as fulfilling requirements in the major or
minor [or special program or concentration], the DUS will
need to confirm that they can be used toward requirements in
the major/minor.
• Classes taken abroad through other institutions and programs
are treated as transfer credit to Columbia, and are subject
to the same policies as other transfer courses. There will be
a limit on the number of courses taken abroad that can be
applied to the major/minor, and they must be approved by the
DUS.
Summer Courses
• Summer courses at Columbia are offered through the School
of Professional Studies. Courses taken in a Summer Term
may be used toward requirements for the major/minor only
as articulated in the department/institute/center guidelines
or by permission of the Director of Undergraduate Studies.
More general policies about Summer coursework can be
found in the Academic Regulations section of this Bulletin.

Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
• Undergraduates majoring in Philosophy or Economics-
Philosophy may propose to write a senior thesis. Students
who wish to write a thesis should approach a faculty member
at the end of their junior or beginning of their senior year,
and begin working on a proposal early in the fall semester
of their senior year. Proposals are due in early December,
and will be reviewed by a committee which will include the
Director of Undergraduate Studies; students will be notified
of the committee’s decision within two weeks. Students
whose proposals are approved should register for their
faculty advisor's section of Supervised Independent Research
for the spring term of their senior year. Theses are due in
early April.
• See the full policy and procedure concerning senior theses on
the departmental webpage: http://philosophy.columbia.edu/

Department Honors and Prizes
Department Honors
• Departmental honors are highly competitive. Normally no
more than 10% of the majors graduating in the department
each year will receive departmental honors. In order to
qualify for departmental honors in philosophy, a student must
have a grade point average of at least 3.6 in the major.
• For students with a GPA of 3.6 or above, there are two
possible routes to consideration:
• A student may complete a senior thesis; those students
who complete senior theses will automatically be
considered for honors without having to be nominated.
• A student may be nominated by a faculty member early
in the spring semester of their senior year; nominated
students will be invited to submit a writing sample.
A nominated student who is also writing a thesis may
• Two courses taken in summer sessions can count towards the
major.
423Philosophy
submit their thesis as the writing sample, or may choose
to submit a different work.
• Both the senior thesis and writing samples are due in early
April. The departmental honors committee will then review
the submitted material and the academic records of the
writers, and will report to the full faculty.
• The full faculty will then decide which students to
recommend for the departmental honors to the Columbia
College and General Studies administrations.
Academic Prizes
• Columbia College Prizes

Course Numbering Structure
• No more than one course at the 1000 level can be counted
toward the major.
• In order to enroll in one of the 4000-level courses, students
must have taken at least four courses in philosophy.
• Students may choose courses prefixed with GR only with the
instructor’s permission. Additionally, because these seminars
are capped, students should register early.
Guidance for First-Year Students
• Refer to the coursework and majors requirements sections.
Guidance for Transfer Students
• Courses taken at other institutions may count only after
review and approval by the DUS (a written record of
approval must be submitted to 708 Philosophy by the student
or DUS). No more than 5 courses taken elsewhere may be
applied to the major, and no more than 4 to the concentration.
Undergraduate Programs of
Study
Required Coursework for all Programs
• PHIL UN2101* or another course in ancient or medieval
philosophy
• PHIL UN2201* or another course in the history of late
medieval or early modern philosophy (e.g. PHIL UN3237 or
UN3264)
• PHIL UN3411 or, in exceptional cases, a more advanced
course in logic
• At least one course in either metaphysics or epistemology
(e.g. PHIL GU4501, UN3601, or a related course to be
chosen in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate
Studies)
• At least one course in either systematic ethics or social and
political philosophy (e.g. PHIL UN2702, UN3701, UN3751,
or a related course to be chosen in consultation with the
Director of Undergraduate Studies)
• At least one majors’ seminar, i.e. UN3912
* Substituted courses must be selected in consultation with the
DUS.
Major in Philosophy
Students considering a major in philosophy are strongly
encouraged to meet with the director of undergraduate studies
early in their sophomore year. All majors must consult with the
director of undergraduate studies each term before registering
for classes in order to plan and update their individual programs
of study.
Students planning to major in philosophy are advised to
begin with PHIL UN1010 METHDS/PROB OF PHILOS
THOUGHT. Beginning students are especially encouraged
to take 2000-level courses, both in the history of philosophy
and in systematic philosophy. These courses are typically less
specialized and less narrowly focused than higher-numbered
ones. More advanced students are encouraged to take 3000-level
courses. The department requires that all majors take at least one
seminar, PHIL UN3912.
*PLEASE NOTE* PHILUN1401 INTRODUCTION TO LOGIC
does not count for credit towards the undergraduate major in
philosophy.* No more than one course at the 1000-level can be
counted toward the major. In order to enroll in one of the 4000-
level courses, students must have taken at least four courses in
Philosophy.
The major requires a minimum of 30 points in philosophy
chosen from courses prefixed with UN or GU:
PHIL UN2101
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY I
PHIL UN2201
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY II
PHIL UN3411
SYMBOLIC LOGIC
At least one course in either metaphysics or epistemology
e.g., PHIL W3960, or a related course to be chosen in
consultation with the director of undergraduate studies.
Select at least one course in either ethics or social and
political philosophy from the following:
PHIL UN2702
Contemporary Moral Problems
PHIL UN3701
ETHICS
PHIL UN3751
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY
A related course to be chosen in consultation with the
director of undergradute studies.
PHIL UN3912
SEMINAR
• Courses taken pass/fail only count towards the major in
unusual circumstances.
• Two courses taken in summer sessions can count towards the
major.
• In some instances, courses in other departments can count
for credit towards the major. For example, the Religion
Department offers courses in philosophy of religion, and
the Political Science Department offers courses in political
philosophy. Questions about whether courses in other
departments will count towards the major should be directed
to the DUS.
• The Columbia and Barnard Philosophy Departments function
together as a unit. The courses specifically designed for
Barnard students (first-year and senior seminars) do not
count towards the Columbia major. But all other courses
in the Columbia-Barnard joint curriculum do count for the
425Philosophy
major, regardless of whether the instructor is associated with
Barnard or Columbia.
• Core classes such as Contemporary Civilization may not
count towards the major.
Joint Major in Economics-Philosophy
• An Introductory course. Most often this will be PHIL
UN1010 Methods and Problems of Philosophical Thought.
• PHIL UN3411 Symbolic Logic.
• One 3000-level course in moral, political, or social
philosophy. (PHIL UN3701 Ethics satisfies this requirement,
as do various other courses offered by the Department from
time to time. Consult with the Philosophy adviser if you are
in any doubt here.)
• One 3000-level course in epistemology, the philosophy
of science, or in the philosophy of one of the particular
sciences. (PHIL UN3551 Philosophy of Science and PHIL
UN3960 Epistemology both satisfy this requirement, as do
various other courses offered by the Department from time to
time. Consult with the Philosophy adviser if you are in any
doubt here.)
• PHIL GU4561 Probability and Decision Theory.
• ECPH UN4950 Senior Seminar in Economics and
Philosophy.
Please read Guidelines for all Economics Majors,
Concentrators, and Interdepartmental Majors in
the Economics section of this Bulletin.
Economics-Philosophy is an interdisciplinary major that, while
introducing students to the basic methodologies of economics
and philosophy, stresses areas of particular concern to both.
These include subjects such as rationality and decision making,
justice and efficiency, freedom and collective choice, and the
logic of empirical theories and their testing. Many of the issues
are dealt with historically, and classic texts of Plato, Kant, Mill,
Marx, and Smith are reviewed.
Two advisers are assigned for the interdepartmental major, one
in the Department of Economics and one in the Department of
Philosophy. Please note that the Economics adviser can only
advise on the Economics requirements and the Philosophy
adviser can only advise on the Philosophy requirements.
The Economics-Philosophy major requires a total minimum of
54 points: 25 points in Economics, 16 points in Philosophy, 6
points in Mathematics, 3 points in Statistics, and 4 points in the
interdisciplinary seminar as follows:

Concentration in Philosophy
Philosophy, as an academic discipline, has significant points of
contact with a wide range of other subjects—in the humanities,
the social sciences, and the natural sciences. A concentration in
philosophy thus can be an attractive option for many students.
Those considering becoming concentrators are strongly
encouraged to meet with the director of undergraduate studies
early in their sophomore year, in order to discuss their specific
interests and to plan their programs of study. All concentrators
should consult with the director of undergraduate studies each
term before registering for courses.
The concentration requires a minimum of 24 points in
philosophy, chosen from courses prefixed with UN or GU. There
are no specific courses required for the concentration.
:
426Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Students may choose courses prefixed with GR only with the

The Physical Education Department offers a variety of activities
in the areas of aquatics, fitness, martial arts, individual/ dual
sports, team sports, and outdoor education. Most of the activities
are designed for the beginner level. Intermediate/advanced
courses are offered at selected times. All courses are designed to
develop and/or improve skills and knowledge, increase physical
activity, and promote well-being. Courses aim to promote
holistic, sustainable opportunities to engage with physical
activity and physical well-being concepts. A major goal is to
provide a positive, enjoyable experience for students, leading to
the development of an active, healthy lifestyle.
The majority of the courses are offered in ten time preferences.
However, there are early morning classes, Friday-only classes
at Baker Athletics Complex, and specialty courses that utilize
off-campus facilities during weekends. A description of the
scheduled activities for each time preference is included in the
Department of Physical Education website.
A list of the activities for the term is included in the Directory
of Classes and on the website. Students may select physical
education courses during online registration. Students may
register for only one section of Physical Education each term.
Physical Education
Requirement
Successful completion of two Physical Education courses is
a Columbia College requirement that students are advised to
complete by the end of the first year. Students may elect to take
one or two additional terms of Physical Education Activities
for credit. Students receive 1 point of academic credit for each
completed term of physical education for a possible total of 4
points.
For more information on this requirement, please visit the Core
Curriculum—Physical Education Requirement section of the
bulletin.
Medical Conditions
Students who request to have their Physical Education activities
limited or waived because of a medical condition should contact
the Director of Undergraduate Studies for Physical Education.
In some situations, students may require an evaluation by a
clinician at Health Services at Columbia in order to receive a
waiver. In consultation with the Director of Physical Education,
students may be instructed to contact Dr. Melanie Bernitz,
Senior Vice President for Columbia Health, who facilitates these
evaluations.
Grading
The grading in all physical education courses is Pass/Fail.
Students who fulfill the attendance and participation requirement
receive a Pass. Those who miss more than the permissible
number of classes and who do not drop the course by the official
drop deadline receive a W (Withdrawal), UW (Unofficial
Withdrawal), or F (Fail). Those who anticipate attendance
problems should contact their instructors or the Director of
Undergraduate Studies for Physical Education.
Swim Test
All students are also required to pass a swimming test or take
beginning swimming for one term to fulfill the swimming
requirement. A waiver of the swimming test requirement may
be granted if a student has a disability certified by a medical
authority that precludes swimming. Students may also request
waivers and accommodations on the grounds of religious
observance or gender identity/expression. All requests for
waivers and accommodations are reviewed by the Director of
Physical Education.
Intercollegiate Athletics
Students who are participating on an intercollegiate team should
register for the appropriate team section of PHED UN1005
INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS. Intercollegiate athletes are
responsible for taking the swimming test. Student-athletes who
cannot pass the test should take beginner swimming at the first
possible opportunity.
Student-athletes who register correctly and participate on a
team receive a Pass; those who drop off a team in midterm and
still wish to receive academic credit must notify the Physical
Education Office and be placed in an activity to complete the
attendance requirement. Otherwise, the student must officially
drop Intercollegiate Athletics or they receive a mark of W
(Withdrawal).

The Study of Physics
The physics major offers a rigorous preparation in the
intellectual developments of modern physics, along with
extensive exposure to the mathematical and experimental
techniques required to conduct basic and applied research in
physics. For the major, the department offers a set of required
courses well-suited to prepare students for the most rigorous
course of graduate study. These can be supplemented by elective
courses in a variety of advanced topics. Although most majors
go on to graduate work in physics, the intellectual skills acquired
in the study of physics can also provide the basis for work in a
variety of other scientific and nonscientific areas.
Research is an extremely important component of the Columbia
physics experience. Because the department has a very small
student-to-faculty ratio, essentially all physics majors and
concentrators engage in experimental, computational, or
theoretical research under the close supervision of a faculty
member during part, if not all, of their time at Columbia.
Current programs of study include:
The Physics major
The Astrophysics major
The Biophysics major
The Chemical Physics major
As of Fall 2024, the Department does not offer a Minor in
Physics, however a Minor will likely be introduced for the
2025-2026 academic year.
Student Advising
Consulting Advisers
Students should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies
(DUS) for all advising questions and concerns, however please
see the information below that describes appropriate advising
contacts for the interdisciplinary majors in Astrophysics,
Biophysics and Chemical Physics.
For the Physics major: Jeremy Dodd, jrd4@columbia.edu.
For the Astrophysics major: Jeremy Dodd, jrd4@columbia.edu,
and students should also consult with the Director of
Undergraduate Studies in the Astronomy Department.
For the Biophysics major: students should consult with the
Director of Undergraduate Studies for Biophysics in the
Biological Sciences Department.
For the Chemical Physics major: students should consult
with the Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Chemistry
Department.
The Physics DUS typically holds walk-in office hours each
week during the academic year (fall and spring semesters), and
may be also be contacted by email. For new students, a Physics
Department information session is held during NSOP each fall
to help students determine which introductory physics sequence
is most appropriate for their program of study. Each spring, the
Department hosts an Open House, which focuses on the majors
offered in the Department but also provides an opportunity to
learn more about research opportunities.
For declared Physics and Astrophysics majors, it is
recommended that students consult with the Physics DUS at
least once per semester.
Enrolling in Classes
The Physics Department offers four introductory physics
sequences.
• PHYSUN1201, PHYSUN1202 primarily for premed
students;
• PHYSUN1401, PHYSUN1402, PHYSUN1403 primarily for
SEAS engineering students;
• PHYSUN1601, PHYSUN1602, PHYSUN2601 primarily for
physics, applied physics and physical science majors;
• PHYSUN2801, PHYSUN2802 primarily for physics and
applied physics majors who have advanced placement in
physics and mathematics.
The department can provide more detailed information about
these sequences. Note that there are calculus pre-requisites or
co-requisites in most cases. Enrollment in the PHYSUN2801,
PHYSUN2802 Accelerated Physics sequence is by placement
only. Students who have a score of 5 on AP Calculus BC and a
score of at least one 4 and one 5 on the two AP Physics C exams
place automatically. Other students should take the placement
exam during the NSOP Physics Information Session.
Please note that all of the above sequences start in the fall
semester (only) each year, with the addition of just one “off-
sequence” (spring, summer) offering of the PHYSUN1201,
PHYSUN1202 General Physics sequence for premed students.
Preparing for Graduate Study
430Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
A majority of graduating Physics majors pursue graduate
study at either the PhD or Masters levels. The Physics major is
designed to provide a strong foundation for students who may
continue to pursue a PhD. Aside from all of the required courses
for the major, students who will pursue graduate study are
recommended to take the PHYSGU4003 Advanced Mechanics
elective, and they may also choose to take some graduate level
courses if they have sufficient preparation.
Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Coursework in fulfillment of a major or minor [or special
program or concentration] must be taken at Columbia University
unless explicitly noted here and/or expressly permitted by the
Director of Undergraduate Studies of the program. Exceptions or
substitutions permitted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies
should be confirmed in writing by email to the student.
Advanced Placement
The department grants 6 credits for a score of 4 or 5 on BOTH
the AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2 exams, but you are not
entitled to any exemptions.
The department grants 3 credits for a score of 4 or 5 on the
AP Physics C/MECH exam, but you are not entitled to any
exemptions. The amount of credit is reduced to 0 if you take
PHYSUN 1001, 1201, 1401 or 1601.
The department grants 3 credits for a score of 4 or 5 on the
AP Physics C/E&M exam, but you are not entitled to any
exemptions. The amount of credit is reduced to 0 if you take
PHYSUN 1001, 1202, 1402 or 1602.
AP, IB or A-level Physics credits are not impacted if you take
PHYSUN 2801 or 2802.
Students may earn a maximum of 6 credits in Physics.
Barnard College Courses
No Barnard courses are accepted as requirements for the Physics
major. For the Astrophysics major, see the requirements for that
program in the Bulletin.
Transfer Courses
When students transfer to Columbia from other institutions, their
coursework at their previous institution must first be considered
by their school in order to be evaluated for degree credit (e.g.,
to confirm that the courses will count toward the 124 points of
credit that every student is required to complete for the B.A.
degree). Only after that degree credit is confirmed, departments
may consider whether those courses can also be used to fulfill
specific degree requirements toward a major or minor [or special
program or concentration].
All transfer courses proposed for consideration for the Physics
major must be reviewed by the Physics DUS. Students should
provide detailed syllabi for review.
Study Abroad Courses
Classes taken abroad through Columbia#led programs (i.e.,
those administered by Columbia’s Center for Undergraduate
Global Engagement and taught by Columbia instructors) are
treated as Columbia courses, equivalent to those taken on the
Morningside Heights campus. If they are not explicitly listed by
the department as fulfilling requirements in the major or minor
[or special program or concentration], the DUS will need to
confirm that they can be used toward requirements in the major/
minor.
Classes taken abroad through other institutions and programs
are treated as transfer credit to Columbia, and are subject to the
same policies as other transfer courses. There will be a limit on
the number of courses taken abroad that can be applied to the
major/minor, and they must be approved by the DUS.
Physics and Astrophysics majors who are considering studying
abroad should consult with the respective DUSes well in
advance, since careful planning is required to make sure that
students can complete all required courses.
Summer Courses
Summer courses at Columbia are offered through the School
of Professional Studies. Courses taken in a Summer Term
may be used toward requirements for the major/minor only
as articulated in department/institute/center guidelines or by
permission of the Director(s) of Undergraduate Studies. More
general policies about Summer coursework can be found in
the Academic Regulations section of this Bulletin. No physics
courses currently offered in Summer Term are relevant for the
Department’s majors.
Core Curriculum Connections
Students may be interested in course offerings in this department
that can be taken in fulfillment of the Science requirement of
the Core Curriculum. See the list of approved courses for the
requirement in this Bulletin.

Other Important Information
The department offers a stand-alone one-semester course
for nonscience majors, one introductory sequence in physics
intended primarily for preprofessional students, and three
introductory sequences in physics for engineering and physical
431Physics
science majors. Students are given credit for courses from only
one of the different sequence groups.
Mixing courses across the sequences is strongly discouraged;
however, physics majors who begin their studies with
PHYS UN1401 INTRO TO MECHANICS # THERMO -
PHYS UN1402 INTRO ELEC/MAGNETSM # OPTCS should
take PHYS UN2601 PHYSICS III:CLASS/QUANTUM WAVE
as the third-semester course.

Bachelor of Arts degree, and role of majors and minors in those
requirements, can be found in the Academic Requirements
section of the Bulletin dated the academic year when the student
matriculated at Columbia and the Bulletin dated the academic
year when the student was a sophomore and declared programs
of study.
Students who entered Columbia in or before Fall 2023
may select from a curriculum of majors and minors and
concentrations. The requirements for the Bachelor of Arts
degree, and the role of majors and minors in those requirements,
can be found in the Academic Requirements section of the
Bulletin dated the academic year when the student matriculated
at Columbia and the Bulletin dated the academic year when the
student was a sophomore and declared programs of study.
As of Fall 2024, the Department does not offer a Minor in
Physics, however a Minor will likely be introduced for the
2025-2026 academic year.
All students who are considering majoring in Physics or in
Astrophysics are strongly encouraged to begin a relevant
introductory physics sequence in their first semester. In general,
the Physics major may not be completed in fewer than six
semesters; most students take seven or eight semesters to satisfy
all requirements.
Course Numbering Structure
Course numbers in the Physics Department broadly follow
the standard undergraduate schema. Most introductory (first-
year) courses are at the 1000- level, with the exception of the
PHYSUN2801, PHYSUN2802 Accelerated Physics sequence.
The Physics major in particular is rather well-defined in terms
of requirements and when they should/could be taken, given
necessary pre-requisites and so is rather “sequential”. Note that
there are two required two-semester sequences:, PHYSUN3007,
PHYSUN3008 and PHYSGU4021, PHYSGU4022, which
in general should be taken in the fall and spring of a given
academic year.
Guidance for First-Year Students
All students who are considering majoring in Physics or in
Astrophysics are strongly encouraged to begin a relevant
introductory physics sequence in their first semester.
The Physics Department offers four introductory physics
sequences.
PHYSUN1201, PHYSUN1202 primarily for premed students;
PHYSUN1401, PHYSUN1402, PHYSUN1403 primarily for
SEAS engineering students;
PHYSUN1601, PHYSUN1602, PHYSUN2601 primarily for
physics, applied physics and physical science majors;
PHYSUN2801, PHYSUN2802 primarily for physics and applied
physics majors who have advanced placement in physics and
mathematics.
The department can provide more detailed information about
these sequences. Note that there are calculus pre-requisites or
co-requisites in most cases. Enrollment in the PHYSUN2801,
PHYSUN2802 Accelerated Physics sequence is by placement
only. Students who have a score of 5 on AP Calculus BC and a
score of at least one 4 and one 5 on the two AP Physics C exams
place automatically. Other students should take the placement
exam during the NSOP Physics Information Session.
Please note that all of the above sequences start in the fall
semester (only) each year, with the addition of just one “off-
sequence” (spring, summer) offering of the PHYSUN1201,
PHYSUN1202 General Physics sequence for premed students.

resources to provide undergraduate majors and minors with the
information and support needed to successfully navigate through
the program. These resources are described below.
Undergraduate Advising
Academic Affairs Coordinator: Owen Mefford,
710 International Affairs Building; 212-854-3707;
obm2106@columbia.eduThe department trains and employs political science Ph.D.
candidates who advise undergraduate students regarding
program requirements, course selection, and transfer and
study-abroad credits. The advisers are also available to discuss
research interests, internships, and post-college plans.
The Study of Political ScienceStudents can reach the advisers by email at
polisciadvising@columbia.edu.
The discipline of political science focuses on issues of power
and governance and, in particular, on political institutions,
both formal and informal. It also focuses on political behavior,
political processes, political economy, and state-society
relations.
The field consists of four substantive subfields: American
politics, which covers such topics as national and local politics,
elections, and constitutional law; comparative politics, which
aims at understanding the political systems of other countries,
both by studying individual states and by engaging in cross-
national comparisons; international relations, which deals with
the ways that states and other political actors behave in the
international arena, including such topics as security, foreign
policies, international organizations, and international economic
relations; and political theory, which analyzes the history of
normative political thought as well as of analytic concepts such
as the nature of justice or liberty.
Other broad topics, such as “political economy,” or the study
of the relationships between economic and political processes,
overlap with the subfields, but also constitute a separate program
(see below). Methodology, including statistical analysis and
formal modeling, also occupies an important place in the
discipline.

Requesting a Faculty Adviser
Students may request a faculty adviser by completing the
Faculty Adviser Request Form and submitting it during the
first two weeks of the semester. The link to the current adviser
request form may be found in the undergraduate forms library on
the department website.
Students may consult with their faculty adviser for any
substantive issue, but the graduate-student advisers must
approve planning forms and confirm that requirements have
been fulfilled.
Director of Undergraduate Studies
The director of undergraduate studies oversees the department's
undergraduate programs and is available during office hours.
While a student's first stop for advising should be the graduate-
student advisers, the director of undergraduate studies is
available as an additional resource.
Economics–Political Science Adviser
Economics–political science majors may consult with the
economics-political science adviser during office hours.
However, students should also see a graduate-student adviser to
discuss major requirements and confirm that requirements have
been fulfilled.
Political Science–Statistics Adviser
Political science–statistics majors may consult with the political
science-statistics adviser during office hours. However, students
should also see a graduate-student adviser to discuss major
requirements and confirm that requirements have been fulfilled.
Enrolling in Classes
Most undergraduate level courses in political science can be
registered for by students at any level. However, seminars,
which are smaller, more intensive discussion-based courses
435Political Science
centered around a unifying theme or topic, require students to
join a waitlist and then receive instructor approval to enroll. This
is done to ensure that students in the major most in need of these
seminars to fulfill their graduation requirements have priority to
access them. Further information on seminars can be found on
their page on the department website.
Additionally, undergraduate students may not register directly
in SSOL for courses offered in the Graduate School of Arts and
Sciences, which are designated by the prefix "GR." However,
qualified students may cross-register for GSAS courses, with
instructor permission, following steps outlined on the relevant
page on the department website.
Preparing for Graduate Study
Students interested in graduate study offered by the Department
of Political Science should consult the department website’s
resources on graduate programs, which include M.A., B.A./
M.A., and Ph.D. programs. Additionally, the graduate-student
advisers can offer advice about and help with graduate school
applications.
Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Advanced Placement
The department grants credit toward the major for work
completed under the College Entrance Examination Board
(CEEB) Advanced Placement Program. Students receive 3
academic credits and exemption from POLS UN1201 INTRO
TO AMERICAN POLITICS or POLS UN1501 INTRO TO
COMPARATIVE POLITICS for scores of 5 in the United States
and Comparative Government and Politics AP Exams.
Barnard College Courses
Barnard College courses may fulfill Columbia major
requirements; however, Barnard courses do not follow the
Columbia numbering system and cannot be used to determine
the subfield within which a course falls. Barnard colloquia
are open to students with the permission of the instructor;
however, Barnard colloquia may not be used to fulfill the
seminar requirement, though they may be used to fulfill subfield
or elective requirements. Note that admission to Barnard
colloquia is by application to the Barnard Political Science
Department only. Please consult with the Barnard Political
Science Department for more information.
Transfer Courses
For the political science major, a maximum of three courses
in political science may be transferred from other institutions,
including study abroad and AP credit. For the economics-
political science and political science-statistics interdisciplinary
majors, a maximum of two courses in political science may
be transferred from other institutions. For the political science
minor, a maximum of one course in political science may be
transferred from other institutions. All transfer credits must be
approved in writing by the Director of Undergraduate Studies or
the graduate-student advisers. Students wishing to count transfer
credits toward the major or minor should send the graduate-
student advisers their transfer credit report, the syllabi of the
courses they want to count toward departmental requirements,
and a statement of how they want to apply the transfer credits to
the requirements.
Study Abroad Courses
Study abroad programs are one way students can enrich their
Columbia education by spending time immersed in other places
and cultures. However, for counting study abroad courses for
credit toward a political science major or minor, students should
consult the above guidance on transfer courses.
Summer Courses
Political Science (POLS) summer courses taken through the
School of Professional Studies are eligible to count towards the
major or minor.
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Undergraduate Research in Courses
All majors write a research paper in two seminars or in the
Honors Seminar. Seminars are small, discussion-based courses
focused on a research topic in political science. Each semester
the department offers a wide range of seminars in each subfield.
Students are expected to attend and participate in these courses,
as well as to write an original research paper. Some students
will write a senior thesis in the Honors Seminar. Details about
writing a senior thesis are below.
Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
Students may elect to write a thesis for consideration for
departmental honors as described below.
Department Honors and
Prizes
Department Honors
The department offers an honors program for a limited number
of seniors who want to undertake substantial research projects
and write honors theses. The honors thesis is expected to be
about 75 pages in length and of exceptional quality.
Honors students perform research as part of a full-year honors
seminar (POLS UN3998-POLS UN3999, 8 points total) during
their senior year, in place of the seminar requirement for majors.
Honors students may, however, take additional seminars to
fulfill other course requirements for the major. Theses are
due in late March or early April. To be awarded departmental
honors, the student must satisfy all the requirements for the
major, maintain a 3.6 GPA in the major, and complete a thesis of
sufficiently high quality to merit honors.
436Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
The honors seminar director provides general direction for the
seminar and supervises all students. Each student also works
with a faculty member in his or her major subfield (American
politics, comparative politics, international relations, or political
theory) and a teaching assistant. The honors seminar meets
weekly for part of the year and addresses general issues involved
in research and thesis writing, such as how to develop research
questions and projects, methodology, sources of evidence,
and outlining and drafting long papers. The sessions are also
used for group discussions of students’ research and thesis
presentations. Students are also expected to meet periodically
with the supervising professor and preceptor.
Students who wish to apply to the Honors Seminar must notify
the department in writing by the end of the spring semester of
the junior year. Please check the department website for the
official deadline. Normally no more than 10% of graduating
majors receive departmental honors in a given academic year.
Applicants are required to have already completed the methods
requirement for the major.
In addition, students are encouraged to find a faculty sponsor
for their thesis proposal. Research areas for the political science
department faculty are listed on the department's website.
Students who are not accepted into the honors seminar or who
decide after the application deadline that they would like to write
an honors thesis may take one or two semesters POLS UN3901
Independent Research I and POLS UN3902 Independent
Research II in order to write a thesis to submit for honors
consideration. Any member of the department's full-time faculty
may sponsor independent study courses. Part-time faculty are
not obligated to sponsor these courses.
Students who choose this path must also complete all the
requirements for the major and maintain a minimum major GPA
of 3.6. Theses are due in late March or early April, and decisions
about departmental honors are announced in May.
Academic Prizes
The Department of Political Science administers the following
prizes and awards. Unless otherwise noted, students do
not play an active part in the nomination process. Rather,
faculty members nominate students at their own discretion.
Departmental prizes are reserved for political science majors.
Charles A. Beard Prize
A cash prize awarded every other year to the student who writes
the best paper in political science during the academic year.
Caroline Phelps Stokes Prize

* Students must complete the methods requirement by the
end of the junior year. A student may fulfill the research
methods requirement with another course inside or outside
the department only with the advance written permission
of the Director of Graduate Studies or the department's
undergraduate adviser. If a course outside the Department
of Political Science is used to satisfy the research methods
requirement, this same course cannot be used to fulfill
requirements of another major, concentration or program.
Seminars
Students are expected to take two 3000-level 4-point seminars.
They may choose from among the seminars offered, though
at least one of the seminars taken must be in the student’s
Primary Subfield (that in which at least 9 other points have
been completed). Entry into seminars requires the instructor's
permission.
For detailed seminar registration guidelines, see the department
website. Seminars cannot be taken for R credit or Pass/D/Fail.
Barnard colloquia are open to students with the permission of
the instructor. However, Barnard colloquia may not be used
to fulfill the seminar requirement, though they may be used to
fulfill subfield or elective requirements. Note that admission
to Barnard colloquia is by application to the Barnard Political
Science Department only. Please consult with the Barnard
Political Science Department for more information.
Major in Economics–Political Science
The major in economics-political science is an interdisciplinary
major that introduces students to the methodologies of
economics and political science and stresses areas of particular
concern to both. This program is particularly beneficial to
students planning to do graduate work in schools of public
policy and international affairs.
Two advisers are assigned for the interdepartmental major, one
in the Department of Economics and one in the Department of
Political Science. Please note that the economics adviser can
only advise on economics requirements and the political science
adviser can only advise on political science requirements.
Course Requirements
For the political science part of the major, students must choose
a Primary Subfield and a Secondary Subfield to study. The
corresponding introductory courses in both subfields must be
taken, plus two electives in the Primary Subfield and one in the
Secondary Subfield. The subfields are as follows:
• American Politics (AP)
• Comparative Politics (CP)
• International Relations (IR)
• Political Theory (PT)
The economics–political science major requires a total of 59
points: 22 points in economics, 17 points in political science, 6
points in mathematics, 6 points in statistical methods, 4 points in
a political science seminar, and 4 points in the interdisciplinary
seminar as follows:

designed for students who desire an understanding of political
science to pursue advanced study in this field and who also
wish to have at their command a broad range of sophisticated
statistical tools to analyze data related to social science and
public policy research.
Students should be aware of the rules regarding the use of the
Pass/D/Fail option. Courses in which a grade of D has been
received do not count toward the major requirements.

The Study of Psychology
The Department of Psychology offers students a comprehensive
curriculum in psychological science, including research
Prior to the start of their final semester, all seniors must submit
a Major Requirement Checklist showing all major courses
they have taken and those they plan to take. The Psychology
department evaluates each checklist to determine whether or
not the course plan completes the major requirements and then
notifies the student accordingly. If the student's course plan
changes, or if it does not satisfy the major requirements, a
revised checklist must be submitted. Departmental approval of
an accurate and up-to-date checklist will help ensure completion
of all major requirements on time for graduation.
Non-Psychology Courses
Some courses offered outside of the Psychology departments
can count toward major requirements (e.g., courses taken in
the Statistics Department; cognate courses offered through
Philosophy, Business, Law, etc.). A maximum of 2 such non-
PSYC courses may be applied toward the major. Courses offered
in the Barnard Psychology or Neuroscience departments do not
count toward this limit.
445Psychology
Overlapping Courses
Students cannot receive credit for two courses—one completed
at Columbia and one at another institution (including Barnard)
—if those courses have largely overlapping content. For
example, PSYC UN1001 THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY
is similar in content to introductory psychology courses offered
at many other institutions, including Barnard; only one such
course will receive credit. Similarly, PSYC UN2630 SOCIAL
PSYCHOLOGY and PSYC BC1138 Social Psychology have
overlapping content; only one will receive credit. Please refer to
the table of Overlapping Courses for a partial list of courses at
Columbia and Barnard that are known to overlap.
Preparing for Graduate Study
Most graduate programs in psychology, including those in
clinical psychology, require:
An undergraduate course in introductory psychology:
PSYC UN1001
THE SCIENCE OF
PSYCHOLOGY
A course in statistics such as one of the following:
PSYC UN1610
STATISTCS-BEHAVIORL

EMOTION
PSYC UN1455
RESEARCH METHODS:

MAKING
Students should also take a variety of more advanced
undergraduate courses and seminars. Students interested in PhD
programs in any area of psychology are strongly encouraged to
become involved in a research lab, and may wish to participate
in the Senior Thesis Advanced Research program (STAR). To
join STAR, students must apply by the early fall of their junior
year.
Students interested in clinical psychology should obtain
experience working in a community service program in addition
to supervised individual research experience. Students should
consult the department's pre-clinical adviser, Prof. E'mett
McCaskill, and attend the department's pre-clinical advising
events for more information. Additional resources to help
prepare students for graduate study in psychology, and for
careers in clinical psychology, are available on the Department
of Psychology’s website. Students may also sign-up for the
preclinical advising listserv to receive emails about events and
relevant information.
Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Advanced Placement
The Psychology Department accepts a score of 5 on the
AP Psychology exam, or a score of 7 on the Higher Level
IB Psychology exam, to meet the Science of Psychology
requirement. The AP/IB Psychology exam does not count as
a course towards their program; students placing out of the
Science of Psychology requirement in this way will need to take
an additional course to fulfill the required number of courses for
their program.
The College Board Advanced Placement (AP) statistics scores
do not satisfy the statistics requirement. Students who have
completed AP statistics may opt to take a more advanced
statistics course to fulfill this requirement with the approval of
one of the Psychology Program Advisors.
Barnard College Courses
A maximum of 5 courses counted toward the major may be
from outside of the Columbia Psychology Department ("outside
Columbia Psych" includes both Barnard and transfer courses, as
well as courses in other departments including Statistics).
The table of approved Barnard psychology courses indicates
which courses have been approved for specific requirements of
the psychology major. To seek approval for a course not on the
approved list to be applied to a specific requirement, students
must contact their program advisor. All Barnard Psychology
courses not on the approved list for a specific requirement may
be applied as elective credit towards the 11 courses needed for
the major requirements.
Barnard Lab courses do not count towards the Research Methods
requirement of the Psychology Major or Concentration.
Transfer Courses
For a course taken outside of Columbia or Barnard to be able
to count toward the Psychology Major or the Neuroscience &
Behavior Major, the following must be true:
• The course should be substantially similar in content and/or
learning objectives to one offered at Columbia.
• The course must have been approved for at least 3 points of
credit by GS or CC.
• The grade received must be a B- or better.
• The course must have been taken for a grade (no Pass/Fail).
446Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
• The course must have been taken within the past 7 years.
If a course taken at another institution overlaps with a course
taken at Columbia, only one will be applied towards the major.
Please consult your Program Advisor if you are considering
registering for a Columbia or Barnard course that is similar to a
transfer course you plan to count toward your major.
Psychology Major
• Up to 3 transfer courses may be counted toward the
Psychology Major. Approval of transfer credits on a student's
Entrance Credit Report toward general requirements for
the bachelor's degree does not grant approval of these
credits toward the psychology major. Once your school has
approved your transfer courses, you then need to confirm
whether they can fulfill psychology requirements using the
Major Requirement Substitution Form.
• Online or hybrid transfer courses may only be applied
towards elective credit for the major. All transfer courses
applied to specific major requirements (e.g., Introductory
Psychology, Groups 1 – 3, etc.) must have been taken fully in
person.
• Students who have completed an introductory psychology
course at another institution should submit a Major
Requirement Substitution Request (see procedure, below)
to verify whether or not this course meets departmental
standards to count towards the major. If transfer credit
toward the major is not approved, the student must enroll
in PSYC UN1001 or PSYC BC1001 to complete this major
requirement.
• Statistics courses taken anywhere other than Columbia or
Barnard may not count toward the major. Psychology majors
will benefit from taking statistics here no matter how well
they did in previous intro stats courses. If you are entering
Columbia with extensive statistics coursework, your Program
Advisor will help you find an appropriate advanced statistics
course that can meet the Statistics Requirement of your
major.
• The Psychology Department allows students to meet the
Science of Psychology requirement with a score of 5 on the
AP Psychology exam, or a score of 7 on the Higher Level
IB Psychology exam. The AP/IB Psychology exam does not
count as a course towards their program; students placing
out of the Science of Psychology requirement in this way
will need to take an additional course to fulfill the required
number for their major.
• College Board Advanced Placement (AP) statistics exam
scores may not be used to satisfy the statistics requirement of
the Psychology Major.
• The same guidelines for transferring courses to count toward
the Psychology Major apply to the concentration, except that
the maximum number of transfer courses that may count
toward the concentration is 2.
Neuroscience & Behavior Major
• The Neuroscience & Behavior major is co-sponsored by
the Department of Psychology and the Department of
Biological Sciences. In addition to one year of college
general chemistry, eleven courses are required to complete
the Neuroscience & Behavior major: seven from the
Department of Biological Sciences and five from the
Department of Psychology (commonly referred to as P1-
P5). Please, consult this page for additional information on
the major requirements for the Neuroscience and Behavior
Major.
• Students should consult their Program Advisor in the
Psychology department before registering for psychology
courses offered outside the department. With the Advisor’s
approval, a maximum of one psychology course from another
institution, including Barnard, may be applied toward the
psychology portion of the Neuroscience & Behavior major.
• Transfer courses taken in any modality (in-person, online, or
hybrid) may be eligible to count toward P1. Transfer courses
must have been taken fully in-person to be eligible to count
for P2-P5.
• Students who wish to obtain credit for a course taken at
Barnard or at another institution should complete the Major
Requirement Substitution Form. To be approved for the
major, the course should be substantially similar to one
offered by this department and approved for this major, and
the grade received must be a C- or better if from Barnard, or
B- or better if from another institution.
• The Psychology Department allows students to meet the
Science of Psychology requirement with a score of 5 on the
AP Psychology exam, or a score of 7 on the Higher Level
IB Psychology exam. The AP/IB Psychology exam does not
count as a course for their program; students placing out of
the Science of Psychology requirement in this way will need
to take an additional course to fulfill the required number of
courses for their major.
• Statistics courses taken anywhere other than Columbia or
Barnard may not be counted toward the N&B major; AP
Statistics also is not able to count toward the Statistics (i,e.,
P3) requirement. Students who have completed a statistics
course elsewhere are encouraged to fulfill the P3 requirement
either with an intermediate/advanced stats course offered
at Columbia, or by taking a PSYC UN1400-level research
methods course.
Psychology Concentration
447Psychology
Study Abroad Courses
Students planning to study abroad should consult with their
Program Advisor (see above) prior to selecting their courses
to see which ones are likely to be able to count toward major
requirements. The official process of approving study-abroad
courses to count toward your major can begin once you have
completed your study abroad semester(s); however, your
Program Advisor can give you their best guess for what can and
cannot count.
Psychology majors: We recommend that you plan to meet
most, if not all, of your major requirements while at Columbia.
The Psychology Major is quite small in terms of course
requirements, to allow for students to explore electives that
complement their major coursework. This also allows for
students studying abroad to spend that semester focusing
on courses that you wouldn’t have had the chance to take at
Columbia.
Neuroscience & Behavior majors: It can be difficult to fit
a study-abroad semester in to the N&B major because the
Biology requirements include two year-long course sequences.
N&B majors looking to study abroad should consult with
their advisors as early as possible to see if it will be feasible to
complete all of your major requirements.
Summer Courses
Any course offered by the Psychology Department during
the Summer Session is applicable toward the same major
requirement(s) as the corresponding course of that same number
offered during the academic year. For instance, PSYC S1001
The Science of Psychology meets the same major requirements
as does PSYC UN1001 THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY.
Core Curriculum
Connections
PSYC UN1001 THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY and
any PSYC course in the 2200- or 2400-level may be used to
partially fulfill the science requirement. 2600-level courses
and some other psychology courses, including PSYC BC1001
INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY and other Barnard
psychology courses, may not be used to fulfill the science
requirement.
All 3- and 4-point courses numbered in the 32xx, 34xx, 42xx,
and 44xx can partially fulfill the science requirement. For more
detailed information regarding psychology courses that may be
applied toward the science requirement, see the Core Curriculum
section in this bulletin.
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
All qualified students are welcome to apply to join a research
lab and contribute to ongoing projects. Students may volunteer
to work in a lab, register for supervised individual research
(PSYC UN3950 Supervised Individual Research), or participate
in the department’s Senior Thesis Advanced Research (STAR)
Program. Information on faculty research is available on the
departmental website. Students are advised to read about
research laboratories on faculty lab sites and visit the professor’s
office hours to discuss opportunities. At the beginning of the fall
term, the department also hosts a Lab-Preview event for students
to learn about research opportunities for the upcoming semester.
Undergraduate Research in Courses
No more than 4 points of PSYC UN3950 Supervised Individual
Research or PSYC UN3920 HONORS RESEARCH may be
taken in any one term, and no more than 2 courses’ worth (8
points total) of research and field work courses may be applied
toward the major. “Research and field work courses” include:
PSYC UN3950 SUPERVISED INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH,
PSYC BC3466 FIELD WORK # RESEARCH SEMINAR:
TODDLER CENTER, PSYC BC3473 CLINICAL FIELD
PRACTICUM, PSYC BC3592 Senior Research Seminar and
PSYC BC3599 Individual Projects. Research courses must
be taken for 3 or 4 points in order to count toward the major.
(See above for further restrictions on applying Barnard courses
toward the psychology major).
Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
Students with strong interests in psychological/neuroscientific
research are encouraged to apply for admission to the
Psychology Department's Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis Advanced
Research (STAR) program in the fall of their junior year or the
equivalent, such that they will be able to participate in the three
consecutive semesters (spring - fall - spring) that are required in
the program.
Important: Students will need to confirm that a professor
has agreed to mentor them before being admitted into the
program. Therefore, interested applicants should reach out
to potential mentors to find a lab placement before applying.
Tip: The best way to ensure finding a mentor is to get involved
in that mentor’s research before asking if they can provide
mentoring/supervision on your thesis. Please read through all the
information below before submitting your application.
Students interested in engaging in a Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis:
The series includes:
1. Enrolling in a 3-semester Senior Thesis Advanced Research
series, which includes a weekly seminar and research
commitment, that must occur consecutively in your Junior
year spring semester and Senior year (fall & spring), or
equivalent [NOTE: this research course includes performing
intensive, independent research with a lab mentor, writing a
final thesis, and giving an oral presentation of the thesis at
the end of the 3rd semester]
2. Enrolling in a one-semester methods course (PSYC UN1920,
UN1420/21, UN1450/51, UN1455/56, UN1490/91) in any
semester during undergrad (i.e., before or during the series).
448Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Students are strongly encouraged to complete this methods
training during or before the spring of their junior year (or
equivalent).
The application is due in mid fall, and decisions are
communicated in time for admitted students to register to begin
Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis Advanced Research-related classes
in the spring.
The application process comprises the following steps:
1. Identifying a lab sponsor: If you think you might be
interested in applying, you should start reaching out to labs
that you’re interested in well in advance of the application
deadline to see if they might have openings for research
assistants and if they’d be willing to mentor you in your
research. Keep in mind that mentoring a student is a
significant commitment on the part of a professor, and so
it may be difficult to identify a professor who can provide
mentorship. Successful applicants typically demonstrate how
their own research interests fall in line with those of their
proposed sponsor and attest that their faculty member/PI has
agreed to sponsor them. Once you have secured a position
in a lab, you and your mentor will need to fill out the mentor
agreement form.
2. Complete the online application: The application will be
made available on our psychology department website, and
comprises a few relatively short questions asking students
to describe their previous coursework and research-related
experiences and to write about their intended research
interests.
Undergraduate Research Outside of Courses
Most students who work in psychology labs do so either on a
volunteer basis or as a paid Research Assistant. See here for
more information on getting involved in a psychology lab.
Department Honors and Prizes
All students aspiring to graduate with Academic Honors
must enroll in the Psychology Department's Psych/Neuro
Senior Thesis Advanced Research (STAR) program.
However, acceptance to and participation in this program
does not automatically result in earning academic honors (see
requirements for academic honors below).
Note the students majoring in Neuroscience & Behavior may
earn academic honors through the Department of Biological
Sciences instead. (Please check their website for more details on
that process.)
Department Honors
The Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis Advanced Research program
is open to students majoring in Psychology or Neuroscience &
Behavior and includes the following:
Senior Thesis Advanced Research Seminar (UN3930): This is a
two-hour, 1-4 credit course that meets biweekly, during which
students present and discuss their ongoing research. Students in
the course also attend the Psychology Department's Colloquium
Series, which features researchers from outside the Department
speaking on a variety of topics in Psychology/Neuroscience.
The seminar and colloquia always take place on Wednesdays
from 4:10 - 6:00 p.m. Students in the Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis
Advanced Research program enroll in this course during the
spring of their junior year and during the fall and spring of their
senior years, or the equivalent.
Senior Thesis Research: Starting in the spring of their junior
year and continuing through senior year, all students in the
Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis Advanced Research program
conduct research under the supervision of a Psychology
Department faculty member or a faculty member/principal
investigator in a psychology- or neuroscience-focused lab
outside the department, including at Barnard College, the
Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, Columbia Business
School, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and other
research institutions in the area.
Research Methods Course: To fulfill this requirement, students
should complete a methods course (PSYC UN1920 The How-
To's of Research; PSYC UN1420/21 Research Methods:
Human Behavior; PSYC UN1450/51 Research Methods: Social
Cognition & Emotion; PSYC UN1455/56 Research Methods:
Social & Personality Psychology; PSYC UN1490/91 Research
Methods: Cognition & Decision-making).
Senior Thesis: Students in the Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis
Advanced Research program complete an original research
project under the supervision of their faculty advisor. Senior
students present their research orally at the last colloquium of
the Spring term, and also submit a written senior thesis.
Eligibility for Departmental Honors:
Students participating in the Psych/Neuro Senior Thesis
Advanced Research program are also eligible to receive
academic honors when they graduate, provided they 1) complete
all components of the program, 2) earn a GPA in the major of
3.6 or higher at the time of graduation, and 3) are recommended
by the Psychology department faculty. Please note that academic
honors can be awarded to no more than 10% of the graduating
class each year, so while only students who have participated
in this senior thesis research intensive are eligible to receive
academic honors, not everyone in the Senior Thesis Advanced
Research program will receive academic honors.
Other Important Information
Email Communication
The department maintains an e-mail distribution list with the
UNIs of all declared majors and concentrators. Students are
held responsible for information sent to their Columbia e-
mail addresses. Students should read these messages from the
department regularly and carefully. They are intended to keep
449Psychology
students informed about deadlines, requirements, events, and
opportunities. Prospective majors or concentrators who would
like to be added to the e-mail distribution list should contact the
Undergraduate Curriculum Assistant in the departmental office.Associate Professors
Online InformationAssistant Professors
The Department of Psychology website provides access to
a wide variety of information for majors and prospective
majors. Among other useful resources, students will find syllabi
posted for most lecture and lab courses and for many advanced
seminars. Students should read the on-line course syllabi prior to
registering for psychology courses. For assistance in finding all
necessary resources, students should contact the undergraduate
curriculum assistant (psych-uca@columbia.edu).
Grade Requirements for the Major
A grade of C-, or higher, must be earned and revealed on your
transcript in any Columbia or Barnard course — including
the first — that is used to satisfy the major or concentration
requirements.
Courses taken on a Pass/D/Fail basis may not be used to satisfy
the major or concentration requirements unless the grade of P is
uncovered by the Registrar's deadline. Students may petition to
have their P/D/F grades uncovered after the registrar's deadline
for the following courses only: PSYC UN1001 Science of
Psychology, and PSYC UN1610 Introductory Statistics for
Behavioral Scientists.
Courses taken for a P grade may not be used to satisfy the
major or concentration requirements, except for P grades earned
in the Spring 2020 semester, and during semesters when CC
and GS enact exceptions allowing P grades to count for major
requirements.

Guidance for Undergraduate
Students in the Department
Majors and concentrators in psychology and majors in
neuroscience and behavior should begin planning a program of
study as early as possible. All necessary forms and information
are available in Program Planning Tips. All majors and
concentrators in Psychology and majors in Neuroscience and
Behavior should complete a Major Requirement Checklist
(MRC) before consulting a program adviser to discuss
program plans. At minimum, all students must submit a Major
Requirement Checklist prior to the start of their final semester,
so that graduation eligibility can be certified. Once the MRC
is submitted, the Undergraduate Curriculum Assistant and the
DUS's will review your curriculum plans and advise if changes
need to be made.
450Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Program Planning for all Students
The department's program goals start with the development of
a solid knowledge base in psychological science. Consistent
with the value psychology places on empirical evidence, courses
at every level of the curriculum nurture the development of
skills in research methods, quantitative literacy, and critical
thinking, and foster respect for the ethical values that undergird
the science of psychology.
Most of these program goals are introduced in PSYC UN1001
THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY, the recommended first
psychology course required for all majors that satisfies the
prerequisite for most 2000-level courses. These goals are
extended and reinforced in our statistics (1600-level) and
research methods (1400-level) research methods courses, as
well as in the 2000-level lecture courses and 3000- and 4000-
level seminars. Each of the 2000-level lecture courses enables
students to study systematically, and in greater depth, one of
the content areas introduced in PSYC UN1001 THE SCIENCE
OF PSYCHOLOGY. These lecture courses are the principal
means by which psychology majors satisfy the distribution
requirements, ensuring not only depth but also breadth of
coverage across three central areas of psychology: (1) perception
and cognition, courses in the 2200s, (2) psychobiology and
neuroscience, courses in the 2400s, and (3) social, personality,
and abnormal psychology, courses in the 2600s. To complete
the major, students take one or more advanced seminars and are
encouraged to participate in supervised research courses, where
they have the opportunity to explore research questions in depth
and further develop their written and oral communication skills.
Course Numbering Structure
Course numbers reflect the structure of the Psychology
curriculum:
• The 1000-level comprises introductions to psychology,
introductory research methods courses, and statistics.
PSYC UN1001 THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY is
an introductory course with no prerequisites, which can
serve as the prerequisite for most of the 2000-level courses.
PSYC UN1021 Science of Psychology: Explorations and
Applications is an alternative version of PSYC UN1001
THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY and fulfills the same
requirements. The 1400s contain the research methods
laboratory courses, and the 1600s contain statistics courses;
these two course types are designed to prepare students to
be able to understand, critique, and conduct the types of
research found in many psychology and neuroscience labs.
• The 2000-level comprises lecture courses that are
introductions to areas within psychology; most require
PSYC UN1001 THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY as a
prerequisite.
• The 3000-level comprises more advanced and specialized
undergraduate courses; most are given in a seminar format
and require instructor permission.
• The 3900s are the courses providing research opportunities
for undergraduates.
• The 4000-level comprises advanced seminars suitable for
both advanced undergraduates and graduate students, and
require instructor permission.
Subcategories within the 2000-, 3000-, and 4000-levels
correspond to the three groups in our distribution requirement
for undergraduate Psychology majors:
1. Perception and cognition (2200s, 3200s, and 4200s),
2. Psychobiology and neuroscience (2400s, 3400s, and 4400s),
and
3. Social, personality, and abnormal psychology (2600s, 3600s,
and 4600s).
Additionally, we designate Integrative and Applied courses
using x800s (e.g., GU4880) and Advanced Topics in Psychology
Research using the x900s (e.g., UN1910, UN1920, UN1930,
UN1990, GU4930)
Note that Barnard psychology courses do not follow the same
numbering scheme.
Guidance for First-Year Students
Students with no prior psychology coursework should start by
taking PSYC 1001 The Science of Psychology. PSYC 1001 or
an equivalent introductory psychology course is a prerequisite
to almost every other PSYC course, with the exception of PSYC
2630 Social Psychology.
Students who have taken an introductory psychology course may
enroll in any PSYC course for which they meet the prerequisites.
The best courses for students just starting out are a statistics
course (PSYC 1610 is recommended) or any of the 2000-level
PSYC lecture courses.
Guidance for Transfer Students
Approval of transfer credits on a student’s Entrance Credit
Report toward general requirements for the B.A. degree does
not grant approval of these credits toward the psychology
major. Students must apply for written approval of transfer
credit towards the major by submitting the Major Requirement
Substitution Form and supporting documentation. This form,
along with additional information about transfer credits can be
found on the Transfer Credit page of our website.
Requirements for Transfer Courses
451Psychology
For a course taken outside of Columbia or Barnard to be able
to count toward the Psychology Major or the Neuroscience &
Behavior Major, the following must be true:College Board Advanced Placement (AP) statistics exam scores
may not be used to satisfy the statistics requirement of the
Psychology Major.
• The course should be substantially similar in content and/or
learning objectives to one offered at Columbia.Psychology Concentration
• The course must have been approved for at least 3 points of
credit by GS or CC.
• The grade received must be a B- or better.
• The course must have been taken for a grade (no P grades).
• The course must have been taken within the past 7 years.
• If a course taken at another institution overlaps with a course
taken at Columbia, only one will be applied towards the
major. Please consult your Program Advisor if you are
considering registering for a Columbia or Barnard course that
is similar to a transfer course you plan to count toward your
major.
Psychology Major
Up to 3 transfer courses may be applied toward the psychology
major. Any transfer courses thus applied count toward the limit
of 5 courses from outside the Columbia Psychology Department.
Students who have completed an introductory psychology
course at another institution should submit a Major Requirement
Substitution Request (see procedure, below) to verify whether or
not this course meets departmental standards to count towards
the major. If transfer credit toward the major is not approved,
the student must enroll in PSYC UN1001 or PSYC BC1001 to
complete this major requirement.
Statistics courses taken anywhere other than Columbia or
Barnard may not count toward the major. Psychology majors
will benefit from taking statistics here no matter how well they
did in previous intro stats courses. If you are entering Columbia
with extensive statistics coursework, your Program Advisor will
help you find an appropriate advanced statistics course that can
meet the Statistics Requirement of your major.
To count transfer courses toward a specific requirement of
the major (e.g., Science of Psych; one of the Distribution
Requirements), courses must have been taken fully in-person.
Transfer courses taken online (or in hybrid format) are only
eligible to count toward the elective portion of the major.
The Psychology Department allows students to meet the
Science of Psychology requirement with a score of 5 on the
AP Psychology exam, or a score of 7 on the Higher Level IB
Psychology exam. The AP/IB Psychology exam does not count
as a course or towards their program; students placing out of the
Science of Psychology requirement in this way will need to take
an additional course to fulfill the required number of courses for
their major.
The same guidelines for transferring courses to count toward the
Psychology Major apply to the concentration, except that the
maximum number of transfer courses that may count toward the
concentration is 2.
Neuroscience & Behavior Major
The Neuroscience & Behavior major is co-sponsored by the
Department of Psychology and the Department of Biological
Sciences. In addition to one year of college general chemistry,
eleven courses are required to complete the Neuroscience &
Behavior major: seven from the Department of Biological
Sciences and five from the Department of Psychology
(commonly referred to as P1-P5). Please, consult this page
for additional information on the major requirements for the
Neuroscience and Behavior Major.
Students should consult their Program Advisor in the
Psychology department before registering for psychology
courses offered outside the department. With the Advisor’s
approval, a maximum of one psychology course from another
institution, including Barnard, may be applied toward the
psychology portion of the Neuroscience & Behavior major.
Transfer courses taken in any modality (in-person, online, or
hybrid) may be eligible to count toward P1. Transfer courses
must have been taken fully in-person to be eligible to count for
P2-P5. Students who wish to obtain credit for a course taken
at Barnard or at another institution should complete the Major
Requirement Substitution Form. To be approved for the major,
the course should be substantially similar to one offered by this
department and approved for this major, and the grade received
must be a C- or better if from Barnard, or B- or better if from
another institution.
The Psychology Department allows students to meet the
Science of Psychology requirement with a score of 5 on the
AP Psychology exam, or a score of 7 on the Higher Level IB
Psychology exam. The AP/IB Psychology exam does not count
as a course or toward a student’s points total for their program;
students placing out of the Science of Psychology requirement
in this way will need to take an additional course to fulfill the
required number for their major.
Statistics courses taken anywhere other than Columbia or
Barnard may not be counted toward the N&B major; AP
Statistics also is not able to count toward the Statistics (i,e., P3)
requirement. Students who have completed a statistics course
elsewhere are encouraged to fulfill the P3 requirement either
with an intermediate/advanced stats course offered at Columbia,
or by taking a PSYC UN1400-level research methods course.
452Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Undergraduate Programs of
Study
Guidelines for all Psychology Majors,
Concentrators, and Interdepartmental MajorsMajor in Psychology
Double Majors/ConcentrationsStudents must complete 11 courses in Psychology or an
approved cognate discipline. To count toward the major, a
course must be taken for 3 or more points. At least 6 of the 11
courses must be in the Columbia Psychology Department.
All students attempting to complete double majors, double
concentrations, or a combination of a major and a concentration
should consult the college rules for double counting of courses.
Overlapping Courses
Students cannot receive credit for two courses—one
completed at Columbia and one at another institution
(including Barnard)—if those courses have largely
overlapping content. For example, PSYC UN1001 THE
SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY is similar in content to
introductory psychology courses offered at many other
institutions, including Barnard; only one such course
will receive credit. Similarly, PSYC UN2630 SOCIAL
PSYCHOLOGY and PSYC BC1138 Social Psychology have
overlapping content; only one will receive credit. Please refer to
the table of Overlapping Courses for a partial list of courses at
Columbia and Barnard that are known to overlap.
Grade Requirements for the Major
A grade of C- or higher must be earned and revealed on the
transcript in any Columbia or Barnard course, including the
first, that is used to satisfy the major requirements. The grade
of P is not accepted for credit towards the Psychology major,
Psychology concentration, or Neuroscience and Behavior major.
Courses taken on a Pass/D/Fail basis may not be used to satisfy
the major or concentration requirements unless the grade of P is
uncovered by the Registrar's deadline. Students may petition to
have their P/D/F grades uncovered after the registrar's deadline
for the following three courses only: PSYC UN1001 Science
of Psychology, PSYC UN1010 Mind, Brain, & Behavior (no
longer offered), and PSYC UN1610 Introductory Statistics for
Behavioral Scientists. Courses taken for a P grade may not be
used to satisfy the major or concentration requirements, except
for P grades earned in the Spring 2020 semester.
Major Requirement Checklist
Prior to the start of their final semester, all seniors must submit
a Major Requirement Checklist showing all major courses
they have taken and those they plan to take. The Psychology
department evaluates each checklist to determine whether or
not the course plan completes the major requirements and then
notifies the student accordingly. If the student's course plan
changes, or if it does not satisfy the major requirements, a
revised checklist must be submitted. Departmental approval of
an accurate and up-to-date checklist will help ensure completion
of all major requirements on time for graduation.
Please read Guidelines for all Psychology Majors,
Concentrators, and Interdepartmental Majors (p.
) above.
Major Requirements
These 11 courses must include:
1. Introductory Psychology Course
2. One Statistics course
3. One Research Methods course
4. One Group I Course
5. One Group II Course
6. One Group III Course
7. One course meeting the Seminar requirement
8. One course meeting the integrative/applied Special Elective
requirement
9. Enough PSYC electives to complete 11 courses
Each course may fulfill only one of these major requirements.
See below for details on each of these requirements.
The Introductory Psychology Course
• PSYC UN1001 THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY
A Statistics Course
Select one of the following:
• PSYC UN1610 STATISTCS-BEHAVIORL SCIENTISTS
• PSYC UN1660 Advanced Statistical Inference
• STAT UN1001 INTRO TO STATISTICAL REASONING
• STAT UN1101 INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS
(formerly STAT W1111)
• STAT UN1201 CALC-BASED INTRO TO STATISTICS
(formerly STAT W1211)

453Psychology
• PSYC UN1450 RESEARCH METHODS - SOCIAL
COGNITION # EMOTION
• PSYC UN1455 RESEARCH METHODS: SOCIAL/
PERSONALITY
• PSYC UN1490 RESEARCH METHODS - COGNITION/
DECISION MAKING
Majors are strongly advised to complete the statistics and
research methods requirements, in that order, by the end of
their junior year. Students are advised to verify the specific
prerequisites for research methods courses, most of which
require prior completion of a statistics course.
Distribution Requirement
One course (3 points or more) must be taken from each of the
following three groups (in addition to the introductory, statistics,
and research methods courses described above):
For those completing the new major requirements, no course
may be counted twice in fulfillment of the above major
requirements: separate courses must be taken to fulfill the
seminar requirement and each distribution group.
Special Elective
The Special Elective encompasses a wide range of courses:
those that cut across and connect different sub-disciplines
within psychology; those that integrate psychology with other
disciplines; those that apply psychology to real-world problems;
those that dig deeper into advanced statistics and methods
topics; and those that offer hands-on experience with psychology
research.
The courses listed here are pre-approved to count toward the
Special Elective requirement. If you would like to count a course
that does not appear on the list, please contact your Program
Advisor prior to enrolling.
Electives
• Group I—Perception and cognition: courses numbered in the
2200s, 3200s, or 4200s.
• Group II—Psychobiology and neuroscience: courses
numbered in the 2400s, 3400s, or 4400s. Also PSYC
UN1010 Mind, Brain and Behavior (no longer offered).
• Group III—Social, personality, and abnormal: courses
numbered in the 2600s, 3600s, or 4600s.
Research Methods courses do not fulfill any of the Group
distribution requirements.
Seminar Requirement
Students must complete one course meeting the Seminar
requirement. A seminar course must be taken for 3 or more
points.
All courses offered through the Columbia Psychology
Department and numbered in the 3200s, 3400s, 3600s, 4200s,
4400s, and 4600s count toward the seminar requirement.
Not all Barnard courses taught in a seminar format fulfill
this requirement—see Barnard Courses, below, for more
information.
Seminars are usually taken in the junior and senior year as a
culmination of the major program, but any students who have
met the prerequisites and gain the instructor’s permission to join
the course may enroll. Enrollment in all seminar courses requires
the instructor's permission; students are advised to contact
instructors at least one month prior to registration to request
seminar admission. Note that honors, senior thesis research
intensive, and supervised individual research courses (PSYC
UN3910 HONORS SEMINAR, PSYC UN3920 HONORS
RESEARCH, PSYC UN3930 Senior Thesis Advanced Research
Seminar, and PSYC UN3950 Supervised Individual Research)
will not meet the seminar requirement.
Additional psychology courses ("electives") must be taken for a
total of 11 courses.
Once a student has met the specific requirements of the major,
any other psychology or approved cognate courses that they take
to complete the 11-course minimum are considered electives.
As described below, these may include a limited number of
research courses, transfer courses, and Barnard psychology
courses not approved for specific requirements.
No course may be counted twice in fulfillment of the above
major requirements.
Old Major Requirements (for students who entered
Columbia prior to Fall 2020)
Students must complete 30 or more points to complete the
Psychology Major. Those 30 points must include:
1. Introductory Psychology Course
2. One Statistics course
3. One Research Methods course
4. One Group I Course
5. One Group II Course
6. One Group III Course
7. One course meeting the Seminar requirement
8. Enough PSYC electives to complete 30 points
Major in Neuroscience and Behavior
Please read Guidelines for all Psychology Majors,
Concentrators, and Interdepartmental Majors above.
454Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
The department cosponsors an interdepartmental major
in neuroscience and behavior with the Department of
Biological Sciences. For assistance in planning the psychology
portion of the neuroscience and behavior major, refer to the
Program Planning Tips website and use the appropriate major
requirement checklist.
No course may be counted twice in fulfillment of the biology
or psychology requirements described below. Many graduate
programs in neuroscience also require one year of calculus, one
year of physics, and chemistry through organic.
Required Courses
In addition to one year of college general chemistry, eleven
courses are required to complete the major—six from
the Department of Biological Sciences and five from the
Department of Psychology. For the definitive list of biology
requirements, see the Department of Biological Sciences
website.
*NOTE: For students entering in Fall 2024 or later, two biology
elective courses will be required. For students entering prior to
Fall 2024, one biology elective course will be required.

following:
• PSYC UN1420 RESEARCH METHODS - HUMAN
BEHAVIOR
Note: Students wishing to use a seminar course not listed
above to meet the P5 seminar requirement must contact their
psychology adviser before enrolling to request permission for an
exception. Generally speaking, permission for such exceptions
is only granted when there is a compelling case related to
the student’s research or area of study. Students requesting
permission to use a course not on this list must ensure that their
substantive coursework in the seminar (generally their final
paper) is on a neuroscience-focused topic.
Exceptions to Biology Requirements
Any exceptions must be approved in advance by a biology
adviser and students must receive an email notification of that
approval. Students may substitute Barnard College courses only
with prior permission from a Biology Department adviser.
A note on double counting and multiple
programs
All students attempting to complete double majors, double
concentrations, or a combination of a major and a concentration
should consult the college rules for double counting of courses.
The psychology department does not place additional restrictions
on double counting. Students with questions about double
counting should consult their academic advisor. Psychology
program advisors do not advise about double counting.
• PSYC UN1450 RESEARCH METHODS - SOCIAL
COGNITION # EMOTION
455Psychology
Students may not double-major in both Psychology and
Neuroscience & Behavior, since both of these programs are
housed in the same department.
Because of the overlap between the Cognitive Science major and
both Psychology and Neuroscience & Behavior, students should
not plan to pursue a double major in those two programs.
Minor in Psychology
The Psychology Department does not currently offer any minors.
SEAS students pursuing a minor in Psychology should consult
with their SEAS advisors; the Columbia Psychology Department
does not administer that program.
For students who entered
Columbia in or before the
2023-24 academic year
Concentration in Psychology
Please read Guidelines for all Psychology Majors,
Concentrators, and Interdepartmental Majors above.
Concentration Requirements
Students must complete 7 courses in Psychology or an approved
cognate discipline. To count toward the concentration, a course
must be taken for 3 or more points. The following requirements
must be met:

• No more than 1 semester of PSYC UN3950 SUPERVISED
INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH or other supervised research
course (taken for 3 or 4 points) can count towards the
concentration.
Except as noted above, other regulations outlined in the
Psychology Major section regarding grades, transfer credits,
and overlapping courses also apply toward the Psychology
Concentration.
Old Concentration Requirements (for students entering
Columbia prior to Fall 2020)
A concentration in psychology requires a minimum of 18 points,
including PSYC UN1001 THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY
or PSYC UN1021 Science of Psychology: Explorations and
Applications and courses in at least two of the three groups listed
under “Distribution Requirement” for the psychology major.
Restrictions on research credits, Barnard credits, and transfer
credits are modified from those of the psychology major as
follows:
1. Only 4 points total may be applied toward the concentration

Special Program in Public
Health
Director of Undergraduate Programs: Dana March Palmer

Some of society’s most pressing problems—gun violence, the
opioid epidemic, climate change, obesity, mass incarceration,
health and healthcare inequalities across the globe—
concern public health. These complex problems and the
emergence of novel challenges in the future demand a nimble
application of public health knowledge and principles,
leveraging the foundations of a liberal arts education in order
to achieve solutions. Viable solutions will require cross-sector
collaborations and systems-level, policy, and environmental
action that will affect the social, political, and economic
determinants of health. Necessary for leaders to solve these
types of societal problems is a broad set of fundamental set
of skills. Critical thinking, analytical, problem-solving, and
communications skills are necessary to contextualize these
problems historically, philosophically, socially, and culturally,
and to conceptualize dynamic needs and evidence-based
solutions to key parts of these problems.
Public health is integral to a civil society. The many
determinants of population health—from the environmental,
social, political, and economic factors that shape rates of disease
in human populations to the biological factors that ultimately
constitute the corporeal mechanisms for disease in individuals
—are complex and intertwined. Moreover, how population
health is understood, protected, and promoted, is replete
with controversies and tensions that are ripe for intellectual
interrogation. As such, population health and its connection to
civil society is an inherently interdisciplinary area of inquiry.
The health and well-being of human populations brings together
numerous disciplines, including but not limited to anthropology,
architecture, biology, chemistry, demography, ecology,
economics, history, international development, mathematics,
political science, psychology, sociology, and statistics.
The special program in public health is intended to be a
secondary emphasis of study that complements the disciplinary
specialization of a major. The goal for the undergraduate special
program in public health is to foster critical understanding
and analysis of the multiple ways in which population health
both shapes and is shaped by civil society, complementing the
foundation created by the Core curriculum. At the heart of the
special program in public health are historical and contemporary
issues in population health in the context of an increasingly
connected, global, urban, aging, and inequitable world. The key
themes of inequality, globalization, urbanization, development,
the environment, and aging serve as the framework for the
constituent courses in the special program in public health.

Special Program in Public
Health
The special program, comprising a minimum of 25 points of
coursework, consists of five required courses (16 points) and
at least three electives (minimum of 9 points) that provide
additional depth and dimension to the underlying themes of the
concentration.
Core Public Health Course Requirements
The required courses create a rich intellectual foundation in
public health, providing students with a multifaceted view of the
social production of health, as well as an integrated exposure
to and understanding of the core disciplines of public health.
Together, they serve to illuminate and allow students to analyze
critically the social production of health and its connections
with and implications for civil society. These courses have no
prerequisites, and can be taken individually, as the student’s
schedule permits.

Elective Courses
Elective courses (minimum of 9 points) in the Special Program
in Public Health will allow students to draw upon courses
offered in a wide range of departments and centers across the
University. Proposed electives must be approved by the Director
of Undergraduate Studies.
Examples of departments with relevant elective courses include:
African American Studies; Comparative Literature and Society;
457Public Health
The Center for Ethnicity and Race; Earth and Environmental
Sciences; Economics; Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental
Biology; History; Human Rights; History of South East Asia;
Political Science; Psychology; Sociology; Statistics; Sustainable
Development; Women’s Studies; Urban Studies. Elective
courses are designed to allow students to add dimension and
depth to their interests in public health, along the main themes
of the Special Program. Electives may also allow students to
amplify the connections to public health in their major area of
study. Conversely, students may choose to take electives that
allow them to gain more breadth in concepts to which they have
been exposed in the set of required public health courses.

The Study of Religion
The Religion Department's curriculum is designed to engage
students in critical, comparative, and interdisciplinary
exploration of religious worlds and phenomena in a variety
of contexts and at the intersection with various dimensions of
culture (such as race, gender, sexuality, class, disability, politics,
ethics, popular culture, museums, media, technology). The
curriculum aims to prepare students to contribute actively to
timely discussions about religion, religious difference, and its
roles in a globally connected world.
Apart from preparing for graduate education in religion and
adjacent fields, majors, concentrators, and minors also find the
Study of Religion to provide them with relevant background
and skills for careers in a variety of fields: Education, media,
computer science, law, business, medicine, and social work.
Religion course offerings are designed to meet the varying needs
and interests of students, from those wishing to explore a few
topics to complement their other studies or to fulfill global core
requirements, to those interested in pursuing a minor or major in
Religion.

Guidance for Undergraduate
Students in the Department
Course Numbering Structure
The numbering structure indicates primarily different
orientations of the courses. Students pursuing a degree in
Religion are not expected to take courses sequentially moving
from lower number courses to higher number courses.
Generally, only 4000-level-advanced seminar courses expect
students to have completed some prior coursework in Religion
or adjacent relevant fields.
Courses are numbered by level and type:
1000-level: Gateway lecture course on "How to think about and
with 'religion' as a category of inquiry"
2000-level: Courses surveying strands of studying religious
practice specified by
• Geography (e.g. China)
• Historical period (e.g. Colonial North America)
• Communities (e.g. Judaism)
• Thematics (e.g. magic, gender, capitalism)
3000-level: Intermediate courses focusing on a particular topic
in a specific context
4000-level: Advanced seminar focusing on a particular topic,
involving student research. (Typically students complete at least
one other course in Religion and parts of the Core before taking
a seminar. But if there is a seminar that is of special interest to
you, contact the DUS and/or instructor and ask. You might be a
good fit.)
Guidance for First-Year Students
There will be an orientation meeting for prospective and new
minors in the fall and spring and fall. At these meetings peers
and faculty will be available for consultations. As the faculty
member who is currently advising and certifying majors and
concentrators, the DUS will also take on the ongoing advising
and the certification for graduation of the students minoring in
Religion.
The Columbia Minor in Religion follows a nodal curriculum,
which makes it possible for students to enter the program at any
point.
Guidance for Transfer Students
Students may apply to count up to two courses of transfer credit
toward fulfilling the Department of Religion requirements.
Requests are reviewed and granted by the DUS.

The Study of Slavic and
Eastern European Languages
and Cultures
The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures is devoted
to the study of the cultures, literatures, and languages of Russia
and other Slavic peoples and lands. We approach our study
and teaching of these cultures with an eye to their specificity
and attention to their interaction with other cultures, in history
and in the contemporary global context. We focus not only
on the rich literary tradition, but also on the film, theater,
politics, art, music, media, religious thought, critical theory, and
intellectual history of Russians and other Slavs. Our approach is
interdisciplinary.
Students who take our courses have different interests. Many
of our courses are taught in English with readings in English
and have no prerequisites. As a consequence, our majors and
concentrators are joined by students from other literature
departments, by students of history and political science who
have a particular interest in the Slavic region, and by others who
are drawn to the subject matter for a variety of intellectual and
practical reasons.
We provide instruction in Russian at all levels (beginning
through very advanced), with a special course for heritage
speakers. To improve the proficiency of Russian learners and
speakers, we offer a number of literature and culture courses in
which texts are read in the original and discussion is conducted
in Russian. We offer three levels of other Slavic languages:
Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian, Czech, Polish, and Ukrainian (with
additional courses in culture in English). All language courses
in the Slavic Department develop the four basic language
skills (speaking, listening, reading, and writing) and cultural
understanding.
Our department prides itself on the intellectual vitality of
its program and on the sense of community among students
and faculty. As they explore Russian and Slavic languages,
literatures, and cultures, students develop not only their specific
knowledge and cultural understanding, but also the capacity
for critical thought, skills in analyzing literary and other texts,
and the ability to express their ideas orally and in writing. Our
graduates have used their knowledge and skills in different
ways: graduate school, Fulbright and other fellowships,
journalism, publishing, law school, NGO work, public health,
government work, and politics. Our faculty is proud of its
students and graduates.
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
A senior thesis is not required for any Slavic major.
Students who wish to undertake a thesis project should
confer with the director of undergraduate studies during the
registration period in April of their junior year and register to
take RUSS UN3595 SENIOR SEMINAR in the fall term of
their senior year. Students can opt to expand the thesis into a
two-semester project register for RUSS UN3998 SUPERVISED
INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH, with their thesis adviser, in the
spring term of their senior year. Senior Seminar may satisfy
one elective requirement; the optional second semester of thesis
work adds one course to the 15 required for the major
Undergraduate Research Outside of Courses
The Harriman Institute provides financial support towards
research projects and travel for undergraduate students from
Barnard College, Columbia College, and the School of General

Please consult the Harriman website for more information.
Department Honors and
Prizes
Department Honors
Students who have a grade point average of at least 3.6 in
courses taken for the major and who have submitted a senior
thesis of outstanding quality will be considered for departmental
honors. Normally no more than 10 percent of the graduating
majors may be awarded departmental honors in any given year.
For more information, consult the Director of Undergraduate
Studies no later than the change-of-program period in the fall
term of your senior year.
Academic Prizes
Robert A. Maguire Prize in Slavic Studies
464Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
A cash prize awarded annually to an undergraduate of high
academic distinction and promise in an area of study concerned
with Russian or another Slavic culture, including literature,
music, art, religion, or cultural history. Established in honor of
Professor Robert A. Maguire.
The award is meant to perpetuate Professor Maguire's legacy
and to ensure that his name remains a prominent feature in the
landscape of Slavic Studies at Columbia.
That Robert Maguire’s legacy should be associated with
excellence seems more than appropriate. Robert Maguire's
standards were the highest, and he held himself to them above
all. Extraordinary language proficiency, scrupulous analysis of
both the words on the page and the culture behind each word,
inspired interpretation, and luminous writing were the hallmarks
of his work. The Maguire Prize identifies these qualities with
Robert Maguire and honors the remarkable students who attain
them not only with a tangible award but by linking their names
with his. Robert Maguire made the Columbia department one
of the top Slavic departments in the country. By awarding a
prize bearing his name to the top student in that department, we
recognize both the student's achievements and Robert Maguire's.
Importantly, the Robert A. Maguire Prize will be available to
students not only in Russian literature and not only in Slavic
literatures more broadly, but also in the other disciplines
that address those cultures. Robert Maguire himself was
as accomplished in Polish as he was in Russian, and his
commitment to music was as profound as his love of language
and literature. Even beyond his own breadth, though, lies
Robert Maguire's conviction that no single aspect of a culture
exists in isolation; he team-taught courses with historians, he
educated himself in Slavic religious culture, and he worked for
years on the relationship between word and visual image. It
is reasonable to assume that he would want a prize bearing his
name to include rather than exclude the fields adjacent to his
own.
Pushkin Poetry Prize
The Pushkin Poetry Prize, which is funded by a 1958 bequest
of Dr. John Paul Mihaly, is awarded for the best translation of a
Russian poem into English. Both graduate and undergraduate
students are eligible. You may submit one or two short poems
or one extended poem. (Collaborative translations are allowed if
both translators are Columbia students.)
The amount of the award is $250. A panel of two judges will
review the translations, and the winner will be announced at the
end of the academic year.
Dobro Slovo
Dobro Slovo was established at UC Berkeley on October 29,
1926, to recognize academic achievements of Slavic students.
In 1963 the National Slavic Honor Society – Dobro Slovo –
was founded with the help and encouragement of the American
Associaton of Teachers of Slavic and East European Languages
(AATSEEL). The present-day Society recognizes the academic
excellence of students studying Slavic languages and literatures
and helps to foster scholarly interest in Slavic life and culture.
There are now over 130 local chapters with a total membership
of 6,200. Dobro Slovo serves as a means for the recognition of
academic excellence in the study of Slavic languages, literature,
history, and culture. The Society serves as an incentive for
scholarly interest in Slavic life and culture. The National Slavic
Honor Society has been patterned after other existing honorary
organizations. The Key of the Society is as representative of
academic excellence in Slavic studies as the Phi Beta Kappa is
for academic studies as a whole.
Qualifications for student membership are:
1. The student must have completed two years (or equivalent)
of study of Slavic languages, literature, culture, or related
subjects with a minimum average grade of 85% (B) or its letter
or point equivalent.
2. The minimum overall academic average should be 80% (B)
or its letter or point equivalent
3. The student must indicate an active and continuing interest
in Slavic languages, literature, culture or related fields of Slavic
studies.
The Chapter Faculty Advisor is responsible for determining the
eligibility of all candidates.

Other Important Information
Slavic Culture at Columbia Outside of the
Classroom
All interested students are welcome to take part in departmental
activities, such as conversation hours, Slavic student
organizations, the department's various film series (Russian,
East Central European, Central Asian, and Ukrainian), and the
country's first undergraduate journal of Eastern European and
Eurasian Culture, The Birch. The Slavic Department has close
ties to the Harriman Institute and the East Central European
Center, which sponsor lectures, symposia, performances, and
conferences.
Study and Research Abroad
The Slavic Department strongly encourages all students to
spend a semester, summer, or year abroad if at all possible.
A summer or a semester studying in an academic institution
in your target country can be extraordinarily rewarding, not
only for your language proficiency but for learning firsthand
about the country's culture and intellectual life. If Russian is
your focus, you can now choose from a vast array of programs
465Slavic Languages
in cities ranging from the highly Westernized Moscow and
St. Peterburg to more "off the beaten track" locations such as
Vladimir or Irkutsk. If you are interested in another Slavic
language, opportunities abound for studying in Eastern and
Central European countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland,
Hungary, or the Baltics.
Various possibilities for study abroad exist, and any of our
faculty are happy to provide you with information about these
programs and to advise you about which one best fits your
academic interests. If you think that you might wish to study
abroad, you should plan your academic program carefully
to make sure that you will be able to fit in all your major
requirements. To talk over your plans, and to determine which
courses in the study abroad program may be approved for major
credit on your Columbia College transcript, you should meet
with the Director of Undergraduate Studies (Columbia students)
or your academic adviser (Barnard students).

Guidance for First-Year Students
The Department offers the Russian placement test twice a year:
in August and early December. The Placement test consists
of two parts – written (grammar and essay—about two hours)
and oral (a 20-minute individual interview). Students who need
a reading proficiency exam, or who have particular questions
about placing into/out of Russian language courses including
heritage courses, should contact the Director of the Russian
Language Program Subject with the subject line: “Placement
Test”.
The written part of the Russian Placement Test must be
completed between the second and first week before classes
begin. The test will be administered online and will be accessible
starting from two weeks before class begin. See the department
website for exact dates.

Polish, Russian, or Ukrainian), though there are possibilities
for studying a second Slavic language as well. Generally, the
major has one disciplinary focus in history, political science,
economics, religion, anthropology, sociology, art, film, or music.
In addition, this program allows students to focus on a particular
Slavic (non-Russian) literature and culture or to do comparative
studies of several Slavic literatures, including Russian. Students
should plan their program with the director of undergraduate
studies as early as possible, since course availability varies from
year to year.
The program of study consists of 15 courses, distributed as
follows:
Six semesters of coursework in one Slavic language (from first-
through third-year Russian, Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian, Czech,

science, economics, literature, religion, anthropology, sociology,
art, film, or music, chosen in consultation with the director of
undergraduate studies. Two of these electives may be language
courses for students who opt to include a second Slavic language
in their program.
Altogether students should complete four courses in a single
discipline, including, if appropriate, the required history or
literature/culture courses.
Minor in Slavic and Eastern
European Language and
Culture
The minor in Slavic and Eastern European Language and
Culture provides a foundation for future engagement with the
languages, literatures, and cultures of Eastern Europe.
The minor requires a total of seven courses, including two as
prerequisites, or between twenty-one and twenty-four points.
• The minor requires as a prerequisite two semesters
of language at the introductory level (or demonstration
of equivalent proficiency via departmental placement
examination or prior coursework), either

The Department of Sociology
Sociology is the study of society. In examining patterns of
association, sociologists explore the interactions of people,
communities, and organizations. In this sense, sociology is not
the study of people; it is the study of the relationships among
people. This study includes the associations between people
and the products of human interaction, such as organizations,
technologies, economies, cities, culture, media, and religion. In
the kinds of questions it asks, sociology is a deeply humanist
discipline and sociologists demand the analytic rigor of scientific
investigation.
In training students in our department, we encourage them to
ask big questions and we work to give them the tools to provide
answers. These tools might mean ethnographic observation,
pouring through historical archives, looking at census data,
analyzing social networks, or interviewing people from various
walks of life.
As a bridging discipline that seeks the scientific exploration of
questions that matter to human communities, such as inequality
and social injustice, sociology addresses many of the same
areas of life as our neighboring social science disciplines. Yet
we often approach these areas quite differently. For example,
problems of economic and political life are a central concern
to sociologists. Rather than explore these as independent
or particular features of society, we seek to embed them
within the complex whole of the social world. Students will
find the Department of Sociology to be a broad, demanding
department that provides its students with the conceptual and
methodological tools to make sense of the opportunities and
social problems of the global communities in which we live.
Department Honors and
Prizes
In order to be considered for departmental honors, majors must
have a minimum GPA of 3.6 overall and 3.8 in courses in the
Department of Sociology. In addition, students must produce an
exceptional honors thesis in the two-semester Senior Seminar
(SOCI UN3995-SOCI UN3996 SENIOR SEMINAR).
In order to register for the Senior Seminar, students must
have completed SOCI UN3010 METHODS FOR SOCIAL
RESEARCH and have had their research project accepted by
the faculty member teaching the Senior Seminar. Submissions
of research projects are due by May 1 preceding the seminar.
Normally no more than 10% of graduating majors receive
departmental honors in a given academic year.

The Study of Statistics
Statistics is the art and science of study design and data analysis.
Probability theory is the mathematical foundation for the
study of statistical methods and for the modeling of random
phenomena. The Statistics major builds on a foundation in
probability and statistical theory to provide practical training
in statistical methods, study design, and data analysis. The
Statistics major is an appropriate background for graduate study
in statistics, social science, epidemiology and public health,
genetics, and economics; or for professional work in such areas
as drug development, health policy, marketing, opinion polling,
insurance, banking and finance, and government.
The Department offers several introductory courses.
• Students interested in learning statistical concepts, with a
goal of being educated consumers of statistics, should take
STAT UN1001 INTRO TO STATISTICAL REASONING.
This course is designed for students who have taken a pre-
calculus course, and the focus is on general principles.
• Students seeking an introduction to applied statistics
should take STAT UN1101 INTRODUCTION TO
STATISTICS. This course is designed for students who
wish to learn to conduct statistical analyses, but do not have
a background in calculus; the focus is on the implementation
of statistical methods, rather than the underlying theory. It is
recommended for pre-med students, and students considering
the applied track of the statistics minor.
• Students seeking a more mathematically rigorous treatment
of the subject should take STAT UN1201 CALC-BASED
INTRO TO STATISTICS. This course is designed for
students who have taken a semester of college calculus or
the equivalent, and the focus is on preparation for further
study in probability and statistical theory and methods. It is
recommended for students considering the statistics major, or
the theoretical track of the minor.
• Students seeking a one-semester calculus-based survey of
probability and statistical theory should take STAT GU4001
INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS.
This course is designed for students who have taken
calculus, and is meant as a terminal course. It provides an
abridged version of the material covered in the two-semester
sequence STAT GU4203 PROBABILITY THEORY and
STAT GU4204 STATISTICAL INFERENCE. While some
mathematically mature students may take the 4203--4204
sequence as an introduction to the field, it is generally
recommended that students prepare for it by taking STAT
UN1201 CALC-BASED INTRO TO STATISTICS.
The Department offers a Major in Statistics, a Minor in
Statistics, and interdisciplinary majors with Computer Science,
Economics, Mathematics, and Political Science. The major
consists of mathematical and computational prerequisites,
an introductory course, five core courses in probability and
theoretical and applied statistics, plus three electives. The
training provided by the undergraduate major is comparable to
a master’s degree in statistics. The applied track of the minor
is suitable for students preparing for academic or professional
work in fields where data analysis skills are valued; it can be
completed without the mathematical prerequisite required for the
major. Students who are more mathematically inclined can opt
for the theoretical track, and complete a minor by taking courses
from the core sequence of the statistics major.

Enrolling in ClassesAdvanced Placement
Students may wish to consult the following guidelines when
undertaking course planning.Columbia College and the School of General Studies award
3 points of credit for a score of 5 on the AP statistics exam.
Students who are required to take STAT UN1101 for their major
should check with their major advisor to determine whether this
credit provides exemption from their requirement.
• It is advisable to take STAT UN1101 INTRODUCTION
TO STATISTICS and STAT UN2102 Applied Statistical
Computing before taking any of the more advanced
minor courses: STAT UN2103 APPLIED LINEAR REG
ANALYSIS, STAT UN2104 APPL CATEGORICAL DATA
ANALYSIS, STAT UN3104 Applied Bayesian Analysis,
STAT UN3105 APPLIED STATISTICAL METHODS, and
STAT UN3106 APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING.
• It is advisable to take STAT UN1201 CALC-BASED
INTRO TO STATISTICS, STAT GU4203 PROBABILITY
THEORY, STAT GU4204 STATISTICAL INFERENCE,
and STAT GU4205 LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS in
sequence.
• Courses in stochastic analysis should be preceded by
STAT GU4203 PROBABILITY THEORY, and for
many students, it is advisable to take STAT GU4207
ELEMENTARY STOCHASTIC PROCESS before
embarking on STAT GU4262 Stochastic Processes for
Finance, STAT GU4264 STOCHASTC PROCSSES-
APPLICTNS I, or STAT GU4265 STOCHASTIC
METHODS IN FINANCE.
• Most of the statistics courses numbered from 4221 to
4234 are best preceded by STAT GU4205 LINEAR
REGRESSION MODELS.
• The data science courses STAT GU4206 STAT COMP #
INTRO DATA SCIENCE, STAT GU4241 STATISTICAL
MACHINE LEARNING, and STAT GU4242 Advanced
Machine Learning should be taken in sequence.
Preparing for Graduate Study
The BA/MA option allows current Columbia undergraduate
students (Columbia College, SEAS, the School of General
Studies, and Barnard) the opportunity to complete both the
bachelor’s degree and the master’s degree (BA/MA) in a shorter
period of time, thus providing an option that is financially
advantageous. The BA/MA in Statistics is open to students from
all majors.
Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Coursework in fulfillment of a major or minor must be taken
at Columbia University unless explicitly noted here and/or
expressly permitted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies.
Exceptions or substitutions permitted by the Director of
Students pursuing a major that requires STAT UN1201 should
plan to take that course at Columbia, even if they scored a 5 on
the AP statistics exam. AP credit cannot be used to satisfy a
requirement for STAT UN1201.
Transfer Courses
When students transfer to Columbia from other institutions, their
coursework at their previous institution must first be considered
by their school in order to be evaluated for degree credit (e.g.,
to confirm that the courses will count toward the 124 points of
credit that every student is required to complete for the B.A.
degree). Only after that degree credit is confirmed, departments
may consider whether those courses can also be used to fulfill
specific degree requirements toward a major or minor.
No more than two DUS-approved STAT courses toward a
Statistics major may be fulfilled with transfer credit.
Not more than one DUS-approved STAT course toward a
Statistics joint major or a Statistics minor may be fulfilled with
transfer credit.
Study Abroad Courses
Classes taken abroad through Columbia-led programs (i.e.,
those administered by Columbia’s Center for Undergraduate
Global Engagement and taught by Columbia instructors) are
treated as Columbia courses, equivalent to those taken on the
Morningside Heights campus. If they are not explicitly listed by
the department as fulfilling requirements in the major or minor,
the DUS will need to confirm that they can be used toward
requirements in the major/minor.
Classes taken abroad through other institutions and programs
are treated as transfer credit to Columbia, and are subject to the
same policies as other transfer courses, including limits on the
number of approved STAT course that can be applied to the
major/minor.
Summer Courses
Summer courses at Columbia are offered through the School of
Professional Studies. Courses taken in a Summer Term may be
used toward requirements for the Statistics major or minor.
More general policies about Summer coursework can be found
in the Academic Regulations section of this Bulletin.

Undergraduate ResearchAssistant Professors
Matriculated students who will be undergraduates at Columbia
College, Barnard College, the School of General Studies, or the
School of Engineering and Applied Sciences may apply to the
Department’s summer internship program. Students work under
the supervision of Statistics Department faculty mentors. The
internship provides a summer housing allowance and a stipend.
Applicants should send a brief statement of interest and a copy
of their transcript to the Statistics DUS by the end of March to
be considered. If summer project descriptions are posted on the
Department’s website, please indicate your preferred project(s)
in your statement of interest.Marco Avella

Students seeking research opportunities with Statistics
Department faculty during the academic year are advised to
be entrepreneurial and proactive: identify congenial faculty
whose research is appealing, request an opportunity to meet, and
provide some indication of previous coursework when asking for
a project.
Department Honors
Students are considered for department honors on the basis
of GPA and the comprehensiveness and difficulty of their
coursework in Statistics and related disciplines. Generally,
no more than 10% of graduating majors receive departmental
honors in a given academic year.

Program Planning for all Students
Selecting a first course in Statistics:
• Students interested in learning statistical concepts, with a
goal of being educated consumers of statistics, should take
STAT UN1001 INTRO TO STATISTICAL REASONING.
475Statistics
This course is designed for students who have taken a pre-
calculus course, and the focus is on general principles.mathematically rigorous course, but do not intend to major or
minor in statistics (for most, this will be a terminal course).
• Students seeking an introduction to applied statistics
should take STAT UN1101 INTRODUCTION TO
STATISTICS. This course is designed for students who
wish to learn to conduct statistical analyses, but do not have
a background in calculus; the focus is on the implementation
of statistical methods, rather than the underlying theory. It is
recommended for pre-med students, and students considering
the applied track of the statistics minor.The 4200-level courses are intended for students majoring in
statistics and related disciplines.
• Students seeking a more mathematically rigorous treatment
of the subject should take STAT UN1201 CALC-BASED
INTRO TO STATISTICS. This course is designed for
students who have taken a semester of college calculus or
the equivalent, and the focus is on preparation for further
study in probability and statistical theory and methods. It is
recommended for students considering the statistics major, or
the theoretical track of the minor.
• Students seeking a one-semester calculus-based survey of
probability and statistical theory should take STAT GU4001
INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS.
This course is designed for students who have taken
calculus, and is meant as a terminal course. It provides an
abridged version of the material covered in the two-semester
sequence STAT GU4203 PROBABILITY THEORY and
STAT GU4204 STATISTICAL INFERENCE. While some
mathematically mature students may take the 4203--4204
sequence as an introduction to the field, it is generally
recommended that students prepare for it by taking STAT
UN1201 CALC-BASED INTRO TO STATISTICS.
Course Numbering Structure
The 1000-level courses (STAT UN1001, STAT UN1101 and
STAT UN1201) are introductory courses. Most students will
begin their study of statistics with one of these three courses.
The 2000-level courses (STAT UN2102, STAT UN2103
and STAT UN2104) are courses in computational and
applied statistics, with STAT UN1101 or STAT UN1201 as a
prerequisite. These are important courses in the minor program;
students pursuing a statistics major will learn this material by
studying the more mathematical treatment given in the 4000-
level courses.
The 3000-level courses (STAT UN3104, STAT UN3105 and
STAT UN3106) introduce more specialized statistical methods
which build on the material introduced in STAT UN2102 and
STAT UN2103. While the statistical methods covered in these
courses can be quite advanced, the mathematical level remains
modest. Again, these courses are part of the minor curriculum,
and students completing a statistics major will learn this material
elsewhere in the statistics curriculum.
Courses numbered 4203 through 4207 introduce fundamental
material in probability theory, statistical inference, data analysis,
and statistical computing; these courses comprise the core of the
statistics major.
Courses numbered 4221 through 4234 cover specialized
statistical data analysis techniques, and are possible electives for
students in the statistics major.
Courses numbered 4241 through 4243 introduce modern tools in
machine learning and data science.
Courses numbered between 4261 and 4265 cover statistical and
probabilistic theory and methods in modern finance.

The Study of Sustainable
Development
Sustainable development is founded on the premise that
human well-being should advance without irreparable harm
to ecosystems and the vital services they provide, without
depleting essential resources, and without posing risks to future
generations. The term "sustainable" refers to managing the
world's economy in a manner consistent with the continued
healthy functioning of Earth's ecosystems, oceans, atmosphere
and climate. In this context, "development" refers to continued
social, political, and economic progress aimed at improving the
well-being of the global community, especially for the poorest
people.
Academic Programs
The Earth Institute—in collaboration with Columbia College,
the School of General Studies, the School of International and
Public Affairs, and the Departments of Earth and Environmental
Science; Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology; and
Earth and Environmental Engineering—offers a major and a
special concentration in sustainable development.
These programs are designed to: engage students in this
emergent interdisciplinary discussion, provide knowledge of
the theory and practice of sustainable development, stimulate
a critical examination of historical and conceptual antecedents,
provide experience in the complex challenges of sustainable
development through direct engagement, and help them imagine
alternative futures for our rapidly changing world. With help
from the Earth Institute faculty, courses are specifically created
to address the very real and complex issues of development as
they relate to the interactions of the natural and social systems.
The major focuses heavily on the sciences and provides students
with a working knowledge of issues on a range of interacting
subject areas. After declaring the major, students are assigned an
academic adviser from within the Earth Institute, who advises
on class selection and career development. Students benefit from
a support system of faculty, advisers, and program managers,
and have access to a multitude of resources for internships, study
abroad programs, and career development.
The special concentration is intentionally more flexible, but its
structure allows students to benefit from the cross-disciplinary
courses and to build the expertise to allow them to address
the fundamental issue of how to move towards a trajectory of
sustainability.
The sustainable development program is structured to ensure
that students graduate with the skills and knowledge to
enable them to advance professionally in the public, private,
governmental, and nonprofit sectors, and to pursue advanced
degrees. Those interested in sustainable development are
encouraged to participate in lectures, conferences, and other
programs sponsored by the Earth Institute.

Enrolling in Classes
The sustainable development foundation courses should be
taken first and students should then work with the program
481Sustainable Development
adviser on further course selection and sequencing. The major in
sustainable development requires a minimum of 15 courses and
a practicum as follows (p. 485).
Students should take the following foundational courses in their
first year at Columbia:
• EESC UN2330 Science for Sustainable Development
(offered in fall)—this course satisfies the science core
requirement
• SDEV UN2300 Challenges of Sustainable Development
(offered in spring)
Course Substitution:
If you would like to have a course count for credit that was taken
outside of the listed program requirements, the course must
first go through a review and approval process. This includes
electives not listed on the pre-approved list, transfer credits,
study abroad, and Columbia courses not explicitly listed on
the requirements list. To request approval, you must submit a
course substitution form, linked below, to Sylvia Montijo at
sm4084@columbia.edu.
completed the application and received a passing grade, your
internship/project will fulfill the practicum requirement. Please
note only unpaid internships/independent studies are eligible for
practicum credit.
Preparing for Graduate Study
Accelerated 5 Year Program: Sustainable Development (B.A.)
and Sustainability Management (M.S.)
Launched in Fall 2015 this companion degree program —
offered in collaboration with The Earth Institute, Columbia
College, the School of General Studies and the School of
Professional Studies — allows students to earn both a bachelor’s
and a master’s degree in just five years. Students are trained
to become sustainability practitioners who understand the
complex environmental challenges facing the world. They
develop practical skills in management, quantitative analysis,
and sustainability to transform the way that organizations do
business.
• Requests for course substitutions will not be accepted beyond
the first semester of your senior year. You may need to
return for an additional semester to complete the program
requirements.Building upon the strong foundation of their undergraduate
coursework, Sustainable Development students who are
accepted into the Sustainability Management program will
learn to draw from interdisciplinary perspectives in general,
as well as develop specific skills and knowledge in financial
management, quantitative analysis, public policy, and the
physical dimensions of sustainability. Students will receive
practical professional training to help them to understand the
systematic and organizational role of sustainability in any
organization.
• Substitutions for the foundational courses (EESC 2330
Science for Sustainable Development and SDEV UN2300
Challenges of Sustainable Development) are not allowed.Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Reviews are completed on a monthly basis and your decision
will be e-mailed to you. A maximum of 4 course substitutions
are permitted for majors and 2 course substitutions for special
concentrators. The limit excludes the approval of elective
courses.Coursework in fulfillment of a major or minor [or special
program or concentration] must be taken at Columbia University
unless explicitly noted here and/or expressly permitted by the
Director of Undergraduate Studies of the program. Exceptions or
substitutions permitted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies
should be confirmed in writing by email to the student.
Practicum Substitution:Advanced Placement
Students in both the sustainable development major and special
concentration are required to complete a Practicum. If a student
wishes to substitute the Practicum requirement with a related
internship or independent study, he/she will need to submit
this form for pre-approval by the program directors. If your
internship/independent study is pre-approved, you will need to
enroll in the SDEV UN3998 Independent Study course during
the same semester you undertake the approved internship/project
OR the semester immediately following the completion of the
internship/study. If you complete 42.5 contact hours, you are
eligible to register for 1 credit. If you complete 85 contact hours
or more, you are eligible to register for 2 credits. At the end
of the semester you are enrolled in SDEV 3998, you will be
asked to submit a Practicum Substitution Application to Sylvia
Montijo at sm4084@columbia.edu. If you have successfullyTo ensure their advanced placement credits are transferred to
Columbia, students are encouraged to work closely with their

Transfer Courses
When students transfer to Columbia from other institutions, their
coursework at their previous institution must first be considered
by their school in order to be evaluated for degree credit (e.g.,
to confirm that the courses will count toward the 124 points of
credit that every student is required to complete for the B.A.
degree). Only after that degree credit is confirmed, departments
may consider whether those courses can also be used to fulfill
specific degree requirements toward a major or minor or special
program or concentration.
• A maximum of 4 course substitutions are permitted for
majors and 2 course substitutions for special concentrators.
The limit excludes the approval of elective courses. No
course substitutions are permitted for minors.
• Students must submit a course petition form, available here,
for review by the program’s Co-Directors for any transfer
coursework.
Study Abroad Courses
Classes taken abroad through Columbia-led programs (i.e.,
those administered by Columbia’s Center for Undergraduate
Global Engagement and taught by Columbia instructors) are
treated as Columbia courses, equivalent to those taken on the
Morningside Heights campus. If they are not explicitly listed by
the department as fulfilling requirements in the major or minor
[or special program or concentration], the DUS will need to
confirm that they can be used toward requirements in the major/
minor.
Classes taken abroad through other institutions and programs
are treated as transfer credit to Columbia, and are subject to the
same policies as other transfer courses. There will be a limit on
the number of courses taken abroad that can be applied to the
major/minor, and they must be approved by the DUS.
Study abroad and internships are strongly encouraged as a
basis for thesis research and to provide students with practical
experience and enhanced global awareness. The Global Fellows
in Sustainable Development Program provides funding for
students to further their studies off campus in the form of
fieldwork and research.
Summer Courses
Summer courses at Columbia are offered through the School of
Professional Studies. Courses taken in a Summer Term may be
used toward requirements for the major/minor only as articulated
in department/institute/center guidelines or by permission of
the Director(s) of Undergraduate Studies. More general policies
about Summer coursework can be found in the Academic
Regulations section of this Bulletin.
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
The Senior Research Seminar, offered jointly with Barnard
College, can be taken in the Spring/Fall or Fall/Spring sequence
and includes guided, independent, in-depth research as well
as discussions about scientific presentations and posters, data
analysis, library research methods, and scientific writing
culminating in the senior thesis. Each student is responsible
for oral research presentations and an extended written report
on a related subject of his or her choice. Completing a senior
thesis with a B+ or better in both seminar courses is required for
departmental honors. As of spring 2024, over 70+ students have
completed a thesis with the sustainable development program. A
list of past SDEV senior theses are here.
Undergraduate Research in Courses
SDEV 4101 Qualitative Research Methods
This course will provide an overview of social science research
methods, with a focus on building a toolkit for undergraduate
students. We begin with an overview of the science of knowing.
How do we generate scientific hypotheses in the social sciences,
and then how can we find out whether those hypotheses are
accurate? An exploration of a range of qualitative research
methods will occupy the majority of our class time, including
interviewing, case studies, questionnaires, surveys, coding,
and participant observation. Toward the end of the course
we consider how mixed methods allow for the integration
of quantitative tools in the social sciences. Throughout,
students will both study and practice these research methods,
experimenting to better understand the strengths and challenges
associated with each approach. The course will end with poster
presentations in which students share their own research and
justify the methods they have employed.
Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
The Senior Research Seminar, offered jointly with Barnard
College, can be taken in the Spring/Fall or Fall/Spring sequence
and includes guided, independent, in-depth research as well
as discussions about scientific presentations and posters, data
analysis, library research methods, and scientific writing
culminating in the senior thesis. Each student is responsible
for oral research presentations and an extended written report
on a related subject of his or her choice. Completing a senior
thesis with a B+ or better in both seminar courses is required for
departmental honors. As of spring 2024, over 70+ students have
completed a thesis with the sustainable development program.
Undergraduate Research Outside of Courses
The Climate School offers undergraduate students research
assistant opportunities. Undergraduates from Columbia
University serve as research assistants on projects related to
climate and sustainable development and the environment with
483Sustainable Development
distinguished faculty and researchers at the cutting edge of this
burgeoning field.
While research assistant positions at Columbia University are
generally awarded to graduate students, this program instead
aims to present undergraduates with a unique opportunity to
be involved in research at a high level and to gain valuable
experience and skills for their future academic and professional
careers.
More information on student opportunities through the Climate
School can be found here.
the student’s choosing. Students may apply for funding for up
to two semesters (fall/spring or spring/fall), which will enable
them to explore the research project more fully than a typical
one semester project would allow. Applications will be accepted
from students from a variety of backgrounds and departments as
long as the research focuses on an area related to environmental
sustainability.
• Denning Global Fellows in Sustainable Development
• Academic PrizesThe Denning Global Fellows in Sustainable Development
Program supports field research for current Columbia
undergraduates studying sustainable development, either as a
major or as a special concentration. This field research may take
the form of actual fieldwork, unpaid research assistantships,
study abroad opportunities*, theses, senior seminar projects,
or independent studies. Funding will only be awarded for
activities that explicitly fulfill degree requirements, and/or
further an individual’s studies in sustainable development.
Ideally, fieldwork should provide an opportunity to conduct
research and hone practical skills in data collection, analysis, and
project management. Awards will vary in amount according to
individual project needs. Current full-time Columbia students
in the Undergraduate Program in Sustainable Development are
eligible, provided they are in good academic standing. Learn
more about previous Global Fellows here.
Stuart Gaffin Award for Leadership and Engagement.
The Stuart Gaffin Award for Leadership and Engagement honors
an individual or group of students in their senior year who will
graduate with either a major or special concentration degree
from the Undergraduate Program in Sustainable Development.
The award commemorates Professor Stuart Gaffin, who taught
the Workshop in Sustainable Development from 2009-2019.
Award selections will be based on nominating and supporting
letters from students, faculty, and staff. Awardees will be
selected based on demonstrated leadership and service in the
spirit of sustainable development either on or off campus.
The award honors leadership, impact, engagement, and
dedication, all of which were characteristic of Professor Gaffin’s
contributions to our Columbia community.Sustainable Development
Faculty
Department Honors and
Prizes

The Field of Urban Studies
The Barnard–Columbia Urban Studies program enables
students to explore and understand the dynamics of cities
and urbanization. Students engage the city as an amalgam
of social, spatial, historical, cultural, and environmental
phenomena. Students study the evolution of urban forms and
social structures, which create opportunities and constraints for
the exercise of human agency. They examine the city in different
historical and comparative contexts, as well as in the human
imagination.
Majors build an intellectual foundation that combines broad,
interdisciplinary coursework and in-depth focus on a particular
sub-field. The core courses expose students to the diversity of
urban studies as a field, while the methods and Junior Seminar
requirements introduce them to the challenge of doing original
research. This prepares them for their independent senior thesis
project, undertaken over the entirety of their final year. We
encourage our majors to use New York City as a laboratory, and
many courses draw on the vast resources of the city and include
an off-campus experience.
• Develop an extensive, clear, and carefully argued piece of
writing.
Student Advising
Advising Resources
• Prospective Columbia College majors should consult
with Amy Chazkel, Bernard Hirschhorn Associate Professor
of Urban Studies
• Prospective General Studies majors should consult with
Aaron Passell, Associate Director of Urban Studies.
• Please send email to urbanstudies@barnard.edu to subscribe
to the Urban Studies listserv.
• Urban Studies hosts Program Planning meetings in the Fall

Guidance for First-Year
Students
URBS UN1515 INTRODUCTION TO URBAN STUDIES is
recommended for first-year students who are considering or
would like to explore a major in Urban Studies.
Coursework taken outside of
Barnard
Advanced Placement Credit
• Urban Studies does not offer course exemptions for
Advanced Placement or other exam scores.
Columbia College Courses
• Courses may be taken at Columbia College or Barnard
College to fulfill major requirements.
Student Learning OutcomesTransfer Credit
Having successfully completed the major in Urban Studies, the
student will be able to:• When students transfer to Barnard from other institutions,
their coursework is first evaluated for college elective credit
by the Registrar's Office. If approved, departments can
consider these courses for credit toward the major or minor.
• There is no fixed maximum number of credits that transfer
students may apply to the Urban Studies major, as long as
the majority of major requirements are fulfilled at Barnard/
Columbia.
Students should present course descriptions, syllabi, and
proposals to count transfer credits toward major requirements
to the Director for approval.
• Describe and explain urban phenomena and relations from
multiple theoretical and methodological perspectives.
• Identify and analyze diverse urban issues and problems,
including their complex causes and the systems that frame
their potential resolution.
• Evaluate approaches to collecting and analyzing diverse
empirical data about cities.
• Design and conduct research on a particular urban issue or
problem, including developing and defending a research
492Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
Study Abroad Credit
• Classes taken abroad through Columbia-led programs
(i.e., those administered by Columbia's Center for Global
Engagement) are treated as Columbia courses, equivalent to
those taken on the Morningside Heights campus.
• Classes taken abroad through other institutions or programs
are treated as transfer credit and are subject to the same
policies as other transfer courses. Accordingly, there will be
a limit on the number of study abroad courses that can be
counted toward the major or minor.
• To receive credit toward the major or minor for a study
abroad course (whether taken through a Columbia program
or another institution/program),students must submit a Study
Abroad Approval form through Slate and obtain the approval
of the Chair or departmental representative.
• Urban Studies majors can generally count two to three
courses taken in a recognized abroad program toward major
requirements. Students should present course descriptions,
syllabi, and proposals to count abroad credits toward major
requirements to the Director for approval before going
abroad.
Summer Credit
• Summer courses at Barnard are equivalent to those taken
during the academic year. Courses that have been approved
for the fulfillment of departmental requirements will
automatically count toward the major.
• Courses taken at other institutions (including Columbia)
are considered transfer credit and are subject to the same
policies governing other transfer courses. To receive credit
for a summer course taken at another institution, students
must submit a Summer Course form through Slate and have
it approved by both the Registrar's Office and the Chair or
department representative.
• Urban Studies students should present course descriptions,
syllabi, and proposals to count summer credits toward major
requirements to the Director for approval, preferably before
taking summer courses.
Senior Capstone Project
The Senior Capstone Project
• All Urban Studies majors are required to complete
a senior thesis. Most do so within the year-long
course URBS UN3992 URBAN STUDIES SENIOR
SEMINAR and URBS UN3993 URBAN STUDIES
SENIOR SEMINAR.
• Those graduating off-cycle (and other in specific
circumstances) may complete the thesis requirement using
two advanced seminars, usually in their area of specialization
(in place of the Senior Seminar), and submit two expanded
essays (20-25 pages) from those courses (in place of the
thesis).

Transfer Courses
- When students transfer to Columbia from other institutions,
their coursework at their previous institution must first be
considered by their school in order to be evaluated for degree
credit (e.g., to confirm that the courses will count toward the
124 points of credit that every student is required to complete
for the B.A. degree). Only after that degree credit is confirmed,
departments may consider whether those courses can also be
used to fulfill specific degree requirements toward a major or
minor [or special program or concentration].
- No more than 12 points from any other degree-granting
institution will be counted as points toward the Visual Arts
major. Approval is required by the Director of Undergraduate
Studies.
REQUIREMENTS:
All applicants must:
- Be either a Visual Arts Major or a Combined Major in Art
History and Visual Arts (note: Combined Art History and Visual
Arts Majors may only apply for one of the two semesters)
- Please complete the appropriate worksheet (major/ Combined

Undergraduate Program
Located within the Institute for the Study of Sexuality and
Gender, and taught in cooperation with Barnard College’s
Department of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, the
program in Women's and Gender Studies provides students with
a culturally and historically situated, theoretically diverse, and
transnational understanding of feminist and queer scholarship as
it engages multiple disciplines.
The program introduces students to key feminist and queer
discourses on the cultural and historical representation of nature,
power, and the social construction of difference. It encourages
students to engage in the debates regarding the ethical and
political issues of equality and justice that emerge in such
discussion, and links the questions of gender and sexuality to
those of racial, ethnic, and other kinds of social difference.

Enrolling in Classes
Certain courses within the WGSS major may have prerequisite
coursework that students are expected to have completed or
pursue before enrolling. These prerequisites are designed to
ensure students have the necessary background knowledge and
skills to succeed in the course. Students should review the course
descriptions and program requirements on the ISSG Courses
page to determine if any prerequisite coursework applies to their
desired courses.
Preparing for Graduate Study
Through sequentially organized courses in Women’s, Gender,
and Sexuality Studies, as well as approved elective courses in
a wide range of departments, the degree provides a thoroughly
interdisciplinary framework, methodological training, and
substantive guidance in specialized areas of research. Small
classes taught by our core faculty members and mentored thesis
writing give students an education that is both comprehensive
and tailored to individual needs.For personalized guidance on preparing for graduate study in
WGSS, schedule an appointment with the WGSS Director of
Undergraduate Studies. They can offer tailored advice based on
your academic and career aspirations, helping you navigate the
path to advanced study in the field.
Graduates leave the program with critical reading, writing, and
analytical skills, and gain the tools they need to analyze systems
of power operating at personal, national, and international levels.
While this prepares some for future scholarly work in the field
of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality studies, others take these
skills and apply them to careers and future training in a variety
of fields, including: law, public policy, social work, community
organizing, public health, film, journalism, medicine, and
other professions where gender and sexuality are currently
being reimagined and there is a need for critical and creative
interdisciplinary thought.Coursework in fulfillment of a major or minor [or special
program or concentration] must be taken at Columbia University
unless explicitly noted here and/or expressly permitted by the
Director of Undergraduate Studies of the program. Exceptions or
substitutions permitted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies
should be confirmed in writing by email to the student.
Coursework Taken Outside of
Columbia
Barnard College Courses
All Barnard courses are treated as part of the available
curriculum and accepted in the major/minor.
Transfer Courses
When students transfer to Columbia from other institutions, their
coursework at their previous institution must first be considered
by their school in order to be evaluated for degree credit (e.g.,
499Women's and Gender Studies
to confirm that the courses will count toward the 124 points of
credit that every student is required to complete for the B.A.
degree). Only after that degree credit is confirmed, departments
may consider whether those courses can also be used to fulfill
specific degree requirements toward a major or minor [or special
program or concentration].
Transfer courses can be considered as transfer credit at the
discretion of the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Once degree
credit has been confirmed by Columbia, students should contact
the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) to request a review
of transfer credit. Please provide course syllabi for each transfer
course you wish to apply toward your degree requirements to the
DUS.
Study Abroad Courses
Classes taken abroad through Columbia-led programs (i.e.,
those administered by Columbia’s Center for Undergraduate
Global Engagement and taught by Columbia instructors) are
treated as Columbia courses, equivalent to those taken on the
Morningside Heights campus. If they are not explicitly listed by
the department as fulfilling requirements in the major or minor
[or special program or concentration], the DUS will need to
confirm that they can be used toward requirements in the major/
minor.
Classes taken abroad through other institutions and programs
are treated as transfer credit to Columbia, and are subject to the
same policies as other transfer courses. There will be a limit on
the number of courses taken abroad that can be applied to the
major/minor, and they must be approved by the DUS.
Summer Courses
Summer courses at Columbia are offered through the School of
Professional Studies. Courses taken in a Summer Term may be
used toward requirements for the major/minor only as articulated
in department/institute/center guidelines or by permission of
the Director(s) of Undergraduate Studies. More general policies
about Summer coursework can be found in the Academic
Regulations section of this Bulletin.
Undergraduate Research and
Senior Thesis
Undergraduate Research in Courses
Building a strong foundation in research questions and methods
is integral to advancing one's understanding of Women's,
Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS). Through coursework,
students have the opportunity to develop critical research
skills while exploring key topics in the field. Here are some
courses that introduce students to research methods and their
significance:
WMST UN1001 Introduction to Women’s and Gender Studies
(or WMST UN3125 Introduction to Sexuality Studies) provides
an overview of key concepts, theories, and methodologies in
WGSS. Students engage with interdisciplinary approaches to
studying gender, sexuality, and identity, laying the groundwork
for future research endeavors.
WMST UN3311 Feminist Theory delves into the complexities
of feminist thought and theory, equipping students with
analytical tools to critically evaluate and conduct research
within feminist frameworks. Through readings, discussions, and
assignments, students explore various feminist perspectives and
methodologies.
Senior Thesis Coursework and Requirements
The senior thesis is an independent research project conducted
under the guidance of a faculty advisor. It allows students to
delve deeply into a specific area of interest within WGSS,
applying the research skills and methodologies acquired
throughout their undergraduate studies to produce an original
scholarly work.
Senior thesis students must be WGSS majors and should meet
with the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) to ensure
they fulfill all requirements before graduation. Eligible students
typically begin working on their thesis in the fall of their senior
year in WMST UN3521 Senior Seminar I.
For WGSS students awarded honors, participation in WMST
UN3522 Senior Seminar II in the spring of their senior year
provides an opportunity to further develop their thesis research
and writing under faculty guidance.
Department Honors and
Prizes
Undergraduate Honors
Typically, honors in Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies
will be awarded to students with (1) a grade point average of at
least 3.6 or higher in Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies
or related courses, (2) a senior thesis that has been recommended
for honors by the professor of the senior seminar and the
student’s faculty advisor, and (3) approval by the College.
A limited number of students are granted this standing, and
final approval originates from the Dean’s Office. However, the
Undergraduate Director, in consultation with the senior seminar
professor and the student’s faculty advisor, may propose honors
for an extraordinary academic performance, with final approval
resting with the College.
Undergraduate Awards & Prizes
ISSG honors undergraduates with three annual prizes
recognizing outstanding intellectual achievement: the Queer
Studies Award, the Women’s and Gender Studies Award, and
the Feminist to the Core Essay Prize.
The Queer Studies Award, inaugurated in 1994, honors an
undergraduate for excellence in research and writing in Queer
Studies. Winning submissions demonstrate clarity, originality,
500Columbia College Bulletin 2024 - 2025 03/28/25
ambition, and are informed by or engaged in critical issues in
Queer Studies.
The Women’s and Gender Studies Award, inaugurated in
2007, honors an undergraduate for excellence in research and
writing in the fields of Women’s and Gender Studies. Winning
submissions demonstrate clarity, originality, ambition, and
are informed by or engaged in critical issues in Women’s and
Gender Studies.
The Feminist to the Core Essay Prize, inaugurated in 2017, is
awarded annually to the undergraduate who is judged by the
ISSG prize committee to have written the best essay on any
topic in Feminist or Queer Studies in one of the following Core
courses:
• Literature Humanities
• Contemporary Civilization
• Art Humanities
• Music Humanities
Undergraduates are invited to compete for all three awards in a
given year, but may not submit the same essay for consideration
for multiple awards. Prize applications can be accessed on the
ISSG Undergraduate Awards and Prizes page.
