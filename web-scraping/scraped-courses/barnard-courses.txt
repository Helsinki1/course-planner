On her “Record of Freshman Interest” form, Zora Neale Hurston, Barnard class of 1928, wrote in response to the question of what vocation or profession she had in mind after graduation, “I have had some small success as a writer and wish above all to succeed at it. Either teaching or social work would be interesting, but consolation prizes.”  No consolation prize was necessary as Hurston became one of American and African American literature’s finest writers, America’s first Black anthropologist, and a Black feminist ancestor and icon. A deep dive into Hurston’s work and writing life, this course reads Hurston as a narrative stylist and theorist in multiple genres: as poet, essayist, writer of short stories, novelist, playright, folklorist, and autobiographer. The goal of this class is to read Hurston closely and widely and to identify and examine her aesthetic philosophy and stylistic choices as one of the first African American women able to have a writing “career.”

 

In Spring of 2026, this class will center the cultural context in which Hurston wrote, using the New York Historical’s exhibition Gay Harlem Renaissance.  Hurston was an active part of a coterie of artists and intellectuals who made up the “queer mentorship and gay-inclusive salons and friendship circles that helped sustain the Harlem Renaissance.” We will also partner with the Digital Humanities Center at Barnard, as well as Barnard Archives, in the preparation of final digital projects that can be shared with the college community.

Home to Harlem focuses on the relationship between art, activism and social justice during the Harlem/ New Negro Renaissance. Exploring the cultural contexts and aesthetic debates that animated Harlem in 1920s to 1930s, the course discusses the politics of literary and theatrical production, while exploring the fashioning and performance of New Negro identity through fiction, poetry, essays, and artwork.  Topics considered include: role of Africa/slavery/the south in New Negro expression, patronage, passing, primitivism/popular culture, black dialect as literary language, and the problematics of creating a “racial” art in/for a community comprised of differences in gender, class, sexuality, and geographical origin.

Black Shakespeare

Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

This course examines Shakespeare’s role in shaping Western ideas about Blackness, in processes of racial formation, and in Black freedom struggle. As one of the most enduring  representations of a Black man in Western art Shakespeare’s Othello will be a focal point. However, this course will examine other “race” plays as well as works perceived as “race-neutral” in tandem with Black “respeakings” of Shakespeare’s works. This class is antiracist in intent and is shaped by several interlocking questions: What is Black Shakespeare? Can creators and scholars separate Shakespeare from the apparatus of white supremacy that has been built around his works? What are the challenges for BIPOC actors performing Shakespeare on the dominant stage? What are the challenges and obstacles for BIPOC scholars working on Shakespeare in academia? Can performing Shakespeare be an activist endeavor

This course offers a chronological study of the Anglophone, Hispanophone, and Francophone insular Caribbean through the eyes of some of the region’s most important writers and thinkers. We will focus on issues that key Caribbean intellectuals--including two Nobel prize-winning authors--consider particularly enduring and relevant in Caribbean cultures and societies. Among these are, for example, colonization, slavery, national and postcolonial identity, race, class, popular culture, gender, sexuality, tourism and migration. This course will also serve as an introduction to some of the exciting work on the Caribbean by professors at Barnard College and Columbia University (faculty spotlights).

This is an introductory lecture course to the study of Afro-diasporic religions particularly its evolution from the period of transatlantic slavery to present. Students will explore the linkages between Africa and its diaspora, particularly Latin America and the Caribbean and the United States. Through an interdisciplinary approach and Black feminist lens, with a focus on the historical, ethnographical, and philosophical, the course will traverse through selected religions and regions such as Santería & Lucumí in Cuba and Puerto Rico, Vodou in Haiti and Dominican Republic, Obeah and Rastafari in Jamaica, Camdomblé in Brazil, Islam in Guyana, African American Christianity and Hoodoo, and Obeah and Orisha tradition in Trinidad and Tobago. Collectively we will explore questions of Black diasporic liberatory practices and formation, queerness, transness, spiritual possession, resistance, and ancestral veneration. Through a combination of lectures, readings, films, audio recordings, and guest presentations, we will explore the historical development, contemporary manifestations, and contentions of these spiritual traditions; their connections and dissimilarities; their impact on visual artists and writers; their relationship to Christianity by way of colonization, and their meaning in the context of the ongoing struggle of Black people to imagine and embody sane, inclusive, healthy alternatives to a pervasive model of white supremacy.

During the journey of this course, we will individually and collectively utilize myriad
materials to examine the intricacies, nuances, and trajectories of freedom,
primarily in literary texts grounded in the United States. However, a couple
of required books are centered beyond the geographical and imaginary
boundaries of the United States. Even though one of the texts for this course
is a “traditional” slave narrative of a previously enslaved woman of African
descent in the Caribbean (The History of Mary Prince), we will examine
different narratives of Black women from the colonial period to the
contemporary era that engage and reckon with the processes of freedom-
imagining, freedom-creating, and freedom-making. We will approach the
subject matter utilizing a variety of genres (e.g., slave narratives, oral
histories, speeches, essays, poems, as well as novels (epistolary and science
fiction). For this course, students will submit 2 short essays and a final
paper/project. Small groups of 2-3 students will also co-lead some sections
of class discussions on selected reading assignments.

Harlem is a community with a long and storied legacy of arts and entertainment that dates back to the late 1800s. Its legacy extends through the many cultural movements that have helped to define the community such as the Harlem Renaissance in the early 1900s, the Black Arts Movement in the 1960s, and Hip Hop in the 1970s and 1980s, to the current renaissance of venues that anchor Harlem as a neighborhood vibrant with varied opportunities for cultural engagement. Harlem is home to several historic and iconic venues devoted to the arts and entertainment such as the Apollo Theater, Dance Theatre of Harlem, the Studio Museum in Harlem, and the National Black Theatre. These and many other venues along with many others throughout the neighborhood have helped to anchor Harlem as a beacon for Black creative expression that has been instrumental in shaping American culture. The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, part of the New York Public Library, stands as a repository for much of this history and as an emblem of Harlem’s extensive cultural history. In recent years, Harlem has also seen a burgeoning of new galleries, performance spaces, and cultural events that have reignited and brought new audiences to the community. In this course, we will explore Harlem’s early history and how it evolved from a place known primarily for its entertainment venues to one with a mix of standard and more cutting edge artistic and cultural ventures. Community, politics, and economics will also be considered as we look at various cultural and artistic movements. As part of our exploration, we will examine whether shifts in demographics and the ideas, notions, and sometimes, myths about the neighborhood have influenced arts and entertainment in the community. We will seek to define what distinguishes arts and entertainment in Harlem from other New York City neighborhoods and how Harlem has contributed over the years to Black arts and entertainment in NYC and beyond. This course will include visits to venues and visits from guest speakers, all relative to in-class discussions and deeper exploration of the space arts and entertainment have continued to hold for the community and for the people of Harlem. Along with guided walking tours, visits to selected venues will help to delineate Harlem’s cultural past and its continuing evolution through the work of artists, curators, administrators, scholars, culture bearers, and others. Students are encouraged to attend events at some of the institutions and venues covered in the course. Dates, times, and links for events, activities, and guest speakers will be provided in advance.

Contemporary Latin American Art

Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

Focusing on South America, this course examines contemporary art produced in the region known as Latin America and its diasporas, roughly since mid-1940s to the present. The first half of the class attends to two tendencies of the 1940s–1970s, abstraction and conceptualism, lionized through a slew of acclaimed group and solo exhibitions organized across the hemisphere in the last twenty years. We will analyze these two tendencies in the distinct social, political, and economic contexts of their emergence in various “centers” of the continent paying special attention to the ideologies of modernization, progress, and economic development; political upheavals including violent dictatorships and other crises; artists’ relationship to Western European and U.S. cultural centers, and transnational circulation networks; and the role of art institutions. To this end, we will pay special attention to how these trends have been historicized to date, and to what ends. The second half of the class will examine practices since the mid-1970s to the present in a comparative perspective: one, through the lens of identity politics and, two, analyzing the dynamics of the increased global dissemination of works from Latin America and by Latin-American descendants. Several visits to art institutions in NYC will be required as a part of the course.

Photographing the Anthropocene
AHIS3004BC
1
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

How have artists been informed and influenced by the natural world? This course will examine how photographic artists have responded to nature, ecology, and the environment. Augmented by literary texts by artists, scientists, poets, and ecologists, we will explore how close-looking might inform an artist’s practice regarding the living environment - its bounty - and its degradation. Readings include texts by Robin Wall Kimmerer, Masanobu Fukuoka, Robert Macfarlane, Terry Tempest Williams, Rebecca Solnit, Barry Lopez, John McPhee, Akira Hasegawa, and others. Calling on a canon of photographic works from around the globe, students will study book-length photographic essays whose makers have seen art as a form of praise of the natural world and those who investigate the relationship between art and environmental activism. Susan Derges; Meghann Riepenhoff; Masahisa Fukashe; Pedro David; Stephen Gill; Ron Jude; Dornith Doherty; David Maisel, Zhao Renhui; Mandy Barker; Pablo Lopez Luz are some of the artists studied. The course will start by exploring techniques photographers have used over the past two centuries to respond to the natural world’s beauty and complexity. During the second half of the term, we will examine how artists have depicted shrinking natural landscapes, environmental destruction, and global warming and why they might question human centrality in the sentient world. Students will produce a semester-long photographic project on an ecological theme. This course will start by exploring techniques photographers have used over the past century to respond to the natural world’s beauty and complexity.

Worlding Otherwise is a studio course exploring how artists use game engines to craft speculative and ecological narratives. Using tools like Unreal Engine and Blender, students will visualize alternate futures, mythologies, and socio-political realities through creating immersive virtual environments. Key questions include: How might the game environment lend itself to storytelling? How can speculative fiction act as a method of critique? What can we learn from artists who blend technology with mythology and alternative futures? The semester culminates in a final project: a short cinematic piece, interactive environment, or hybrid installation created within a game engine.

Rewriting History: Queer-Feminist Art from the 1970s to Now
AHIS3625BC
1
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

In 1987, the queer-feminist Chicana scholar and poet Gloria Anzaldúa reflected on the politics of writing and rewriting histories. Mobilized by the social revolutions of the 1970s and 1980s, Anzaldúa sought to intervene in contemporary history, arguing that the act of retrieval—mining and sifting through our past—is necessary for sensing and creating uninhibited possibilities. Drawing on Anzaldúa’s understanding of the stakes of historiography, this course explores how artists have sought to reimagine queer-feminist pasts and enact latent futures. It focuses on the period from the 1970s onward, when the proliferation of mnemonic, time-based media, such as video, sound, slides, and photography, as well as ephemeral forms like performance and participation, emerged as significant material and conceptual foci for artists. Artists’ engagements with institutions crucial to the creation and circulation of history, memory, and knowledge—such as universities, the mass media, AI companies, and museums—are examined alongside enduring queer-feminist themes of education, motherhood, family, home, exile, kin, and futurity. Students will become cognizant of how contemporary art influences cultural, political, and social traditions and institutions, and how “old” and “new” ideas co-exist and conflict. The course offers an art historical perspective on contemporary art, mapping its relations to late modern art, while also foregrounding the question: how can we, as “contemporaries,” engage with art and art history in a way that responds to the demands of the present? Artists we examine include Mary Kelly, Ana Mendieta, Magali Lara, Jenny Holzer, Emily Kame Kngwarray, Madeleine Hunt-Ehrlich, D. Harding, Simone Leigh, and Jesse Darling. Writers include Anzaldúa, Rosalyn Deutsche, Tina Campt, Aileen Moreton Robinson, and Ruha Benjamin.

Prints in 17th-Century Holland: A Curatorial Seminar
AHIS3782BC
1
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

Holland in the seventeenth century was home to some of the most innovative and influential printmakers in the history of art, most important among them, Rembrandt van Rijn. In addition, known for producing the most professional engravers, it became the main center for the issuing and distribution of prints in Europe. Held primarily in The Met’s Drawings and Prints Study Room, this class examines printmaking from this period in its many forms – from masterworks of Dutch landscape to political broadsheets. Reproductive printmakers and peintres-graveur, professional printmakers and amateurs will be considered. How prints were made, published, and sold will be explored. Students will learn how to identify techniques as well as quality of impression by examining original works in the collection of The Met’s Department of Drawings and Prints. We will also look at the subject from the point of view of the museum curator – how works are collected and exhibitions created.

This visual arts seminar explores the pirating, transformation, and circulation of media from the 1960s to the present. It examines the ways that media artists question public participation, democratic commitment, and collective memory. During the 1960s in the United States and abroad, the promise of networked communication prompted a consideration of global connectivity that brought artists and artworks outside of the gallery into the public sphere. Artist, often activists, explored the dissemination of information, and they commandeered messaging. Many of these artists positioned their output against mainstream media, while other artists seized existing media streams with the aim, optimistically, to alter them. Case studies include Stan VanDerBeek, Dara Birnbaum, Black Audio Collective, Tiffany Sia, Sondra Perry, and CAMP.  This course brings together seminar discussions, the practice of making, and the hosting of practitioners; it is designed to offer students an introduction to various aspects of media as it is crafted and curated within and without museum environments.

Photo as Material: A Studio Lab in Interdisciplinary Practices

Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

Images today can feel increasingly unstable, untethered to physical and interpersonal experience, and also unstoppable, generating and proliferating at accelerating speeds. What do we do with all this material? What are the global consequences of the mass circulation of images? And how do artists specifically make sense of the contemporary state of photography? This course invites students into a non-conventional, interdisciplinary approach to making, reading, critiquing, and relating to images. We begin with the fundamentally physical elements of photography—space, light, and lens—and end with the embedded histories, social relations, and personal narratives that photographs can trace or carry. We discuss case studies and readings by and about artists and theorists who research and make work across international contexts, exploring, for example, how early colonial histories of photography prefigure its contemporary conditions, and how images can echo or challenge patterns of displacement and resistance. We create artworks informed by this research, exploring how to physically manipulate, present, and disseminate images in hands-on thematic projects that push photography beyond the screen or frame and into the material world.

This seminar will take an interdisciplinary approach to the history of the complex and dynamic city of Tokyo from the mid-19th century to the present. The class will discuss the impact that industrialization and sustained migration have had on the city’s housing and infrastructure and will examine the often equivocal and incomplete urban planning projects that have attempted to address these changes from the Ginza Brick Town of the 1870s, to the reconstruction efforts after the Great Kanto Earthquake. We will examine the impact of and response to natural disasters and war. We will discuss the emergence of so-called “new town” suburban developments since the 1960s and the ways in which these new urban forms reshaped daily life. We will discuss the bucolic prints of the 1910s through the 1930s that obscured the crowding, pollution and political violence and compare them with the more politically engaged prints and journalistic photographs of the era. We will also consider the apocalyptic imagery that is so pervasive in the treatment of Tokyo in post-war film and anime. There are no prerequisites, but coursework in modern art history, urban studies, and modern Japanese history are highly recommended.

“Be like a duck. Calm on the surface, but always paddling like the dickens underneath.”,Michael Caine , We do not live our own desires. Pressing ourselves into heavy molds not made for our bodies compresses us, tears our skin, and bruises our features. It is hard to breathe. We sink. Weight harbors the downward pull. It attaches itself in many ways but there are countless ways to set it down, to be free. This takes practice and skill. The common task of this visual arts seminar is to distinguish ourselves from the weight we carry. Through a variety or reading, writing, and making activities we shall seek out and contact levity: that gravity that changes our bodies, make us light of touch, aerates and propels us toward the state of buoyancy. Not for the faint of heart.

The main objective of the course is to discover the meanings that these literature offer, not just for the original audience or for the respective cultures, but for us. As such, it is not a survey or a lecture-based course. Rather than being taught what meanings are to be derived from the texts, we explore meanings together, informed by in-depth reading and thorough ongoing discussion.

Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

The politics of what and who counts as worthy, good, or pure mediates possibilities for political and legal life. This course takes as its central question: how do certain ideas around purity and innocence come to appear natural? By considering a wide range of topics including carceral studies, immigration, race-making, settler colonialism, gender and sexuality and cultural studies, we will uncover the ways that cultural objects circulate and do political work. How are notions of race, crime, and purity produced, policed, and lived? And finally, how might we live otherwise—against innocence?

What is good sex? What, even, is sex? Who should be having it with whom, and when? Why does sex hurt sometimes? Why does it feel incredible, when it does? What makes sex healthy? Normal? Who says? How do they know? Why?

Across the past hundred and fifty years, time doctors, biologists, psychologists, feminists, phrenologists, and LGBTQ activists have spent lifetimes struggling over the answers to these questions and more. In this class, we will explore the growth and development of the field of sexology, its vast impact on U.S. and German life and its imbrications with structures of oppression and visions of (often imperfect) liberation. To do so, we will read a range of both primary and secondary sources from a variety of different schools and perspectives.

The attempt to scientifically study and define sex fundamentally reshaped both sex and science. It changed how everyday people lived their lives and helping give birth to new scientific disciplines. It also helped produce and police idea of normal, healthy sex, and provided evolutionary justifications for heterosexuality and patriarchy. The activist response – both in and outside of the field of sexology – helped build the modern feminist and LGBTQ movements and reshaped how everyday people made sex of sex, gender, and sexuality. Even if deeply flawed, sexology was also widely contentious, with major scholars having their books burned and banned in both the United States and Germany.

Life as a trans person can feel like an unrelenting cacophony of hammers. Around the world, fascist
parties and paramilitaries have set their sights on transgender people and through a torrent of
accusations of crime and depravity all but authorized violence against trans people. Through
explorations of trans* history and social movements in the United States, Turkey, India, and Pakistan
(and to a lesser extent Argentina), this course will provide a space to both understand the global
anti-gender and anti-trans panic and to relate ourselves to the strategies that trans people have used
to both survive and the demands that they have made for structural change and liberation. The goal
of this course will be to provide a space of critical study and a site of learning to be in community as
well as to equip you with both the knowledge and capacity to understand and intervene in
contemporary trans panics wherever you encounter them. Assignments will be a combination of
collaborative skill-building, self-reflections, and analyses of the tactics and strategies employed by
social movements.

LAB METHODS ARCHAEOLOGY
ANTH2012BC
1
Satisfies 3 credit Science Lecture or Lab Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

Only the most recent chapters of the past are able to be studied using traditional historiographical methods focused on archives of textual documents. How, then, are we to analyze the deep history of human experiences prior to the written word? And even when textual archives do survive from a given historical period, these archives are typically biased toward the perspectives of those in power. How, then, are we to undertake analyses of the past that take into account the lives and experiences of all of society’s members, including the poor, the working class, the colonized, and others whose voices appear far less frequently in historical documents? From its disciplinary origins in nineteenth century antiquarianism, archaeology has grown to become a rigorous science of the past, dedicated to the exploration of long-term and inclusive social histories.

“Laboratory Methods in Archaeology” is an intensive introduction to the analysis of archaeological artifacts and samples in which we explore how the organic and inorganic remains from archaeological sites can be used to build rigorous claims about the human past. The 2022 iteration of the course centers on assemblages from two sites, both excavated by Barnard’s archaeological field program in the Taos region of northern New Mexico: (1) the Spanish colonial site of San Antonio del Embudo founded in 1725 and (2) the hippie commune known as New Buffalo, founded in 1967. Participants in ANTH BC2012 will be introduced to the history, geology, and ecology of the Taos region, as well as to the excavation histories of the two sites. Specialized laboratory modules focus on the analysis of chipped stone artifacts ceramics, animal bone, glass, and industrial artifacts.

The course only demands participation in the seminars and laboratory modules and successful completion of the written assignments, but all students are encouraged to develop specialized research projects to be subsequently expanded into either (1) a senior thesis project or (2) a conference presentation at the Society for American Archaeology, Society for Historical Archaeology, or Theoretical Archaeology Group meeting.

Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)

Sustainability Focused

This course focuses on some of the present, and possible future, socio-ecological conditions of life on planet earth. In particular we will work to understand the historic, economic, political, and socio-cultural forces that created the conditions we call climate change. With this we will take a particular interest in the question of how race, ethnicity, Indigeneity, class, and gender articulate with the material effects of climate change. The course also focuses on how we, as scholars, citizens, and activists can work to alter these current conditions in ways that foster social and ecological justice for all living beings. Although we will ground our scholarship in anthropology, to encourage interdisciplinary and even transdisciplinary thought, weekly readings will be drawn from across scholarly and activist canons. While becoming familiar with scholarly and activist conversations about space and place, risk and vulnerability, and ontology and epistemology, we will work through a series of recent events as case studies to understand causes, effects, affects, and potential solutions.

Gender Archaeolxgy
ANTH3223BC
1
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

This seminar critically reexamines the ancient world from the perspective of gender archaeology. Though the seedlings of gender archaeology were first sown by of feminist archaeologists during the 70’s and 80’s, this approach involves far more than simply ‘womanizing’ androcentric narratives of past. Rather, gender archaeology criticizes interpretations of the past that transplant contemporary social roles onto the archaeological past, casting the divisions and inequalities of today as both timeless and natural. This class challenges the idea of a singular past, instead championing a turn towards multiple, rich, messy, intersectional pasts. The ‘x’ in ‘archaeolxgy’ is an explicit signal of our focus on this diversity of pasts and a call for a more inclusive field of practice today.

This seminar considers what it means to be of a place and to think with and be committed to that place—environmentally, politically, and spiritually. After locating ourselves in our own particular places and place-based commitments, our attention turns to the Indigenous traditions of North America, to accounts of tribal emergence and pre-colonial being, to colonial histories of land dispossession, to ongoing struggles to protect ecological health and land-based sovereignty, to the epistemological and moral systems that have developed over the course of many millennia of living with and for the land, and to the contributions such systems might make to our collective future. The seminar’s title is borrowed from an essay on “Indigenous place-thought” by Mohawk/Anishinaabe scholar Vanessa Watts.

Madness in The Welfare City: Freedom and Capture in American Social Service Systems
ANTH3242X
1
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

Madness in the Welfare City: Freedom and Capture in American Social Service Systems examines how contemporary welfare and nonprofit public health, housing, and mental health systems shape daily life and inner worlds. The course explores the psychic life of social service systems where care is often delivered  by intermediary nonprofits. We examine how clients come to feel and/or understand that money is made off them, that they are being surveilled, manipulated, or disappeared inside care systems; and how these understandings and attendant feelings reflect the extraction and opacity characteristic of devolved social service systems.

Moving across ethnography, political anthropology, and psychoanalytic readings, we ask how these systems produce forms of distress that may appear as paranoia, withdrawal, or deadly forms of self-harm. How are madness and reason, greed and altruism, freedom and captivity, distributed in encounters with care providers on the ground?

By the end of the course, students will be able to connect political economy, affect theory, and psychoanalytic approaches to understand how decentralized welfare regimes alternately trap and exclude clients—a process that can be experienced as madness itself. Students will map a local care system for their final project.

Sin, Disease, Subversion and the Experience of Race in Latin America
ANTH3243BC

Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

Course Description This course provides an exploration of how race and racism are produced, reproduced, and resisted from a Latin American perspective. We will examine a conception of race that is often ambiguous, hybrid, and fluid, yet coexists with deeply entrenched forms of racism. We begin by tracing the origins of racial formations to the colonial period, focusing on how race and religion became intertwined. The course then investigates Latin America's role in the medicalization of racialized bodies, particularly in the context of nation-building projects. We will analyze how racism has operated during periods of political violence, authoritarian rule, and transitions to democracy. Given the region's vast heterogeneity, we will critically examine "Latin America" as a category and use representative case studies to explore how race is mediated through signifiers such as education, gender, geography, occupation, dress, language, and religion—while ultimately being inscribed on and through the body. Students will explore Indigenous ontologies and epistemologies, and reflect on how the legacies of colonial and state violence persist but are contested. The first half of this course provides an overview of historical events and theoretical debates around the study of race in Latin America. The second half is dedicated to reading ethnographic work on questions of race. The selected books present cases in Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Puerto Rico, and of immigrants in the United States.

SOUTH ASIA
ANTH3661UN
1

This course draws on ethnography, history, fiction, and other genres to think about diverse peoples and places in the region known as South Asia. Rather than attempt to fix or define "South Asia" as a singular category, we will explore how particular social and scholarly categories through which dimensions of South Asian life have come to be known (such as caste, class, religion, gender, sexuality, disability, and kinship) are experienced, negotiated, and reworked by actual persons in specific situations. By examining both categories and practices, we will ask: What kinds of relationships exist between the messiness of everyday life and the classifications used by both scholars and "local" people to describe and make sense of it? How do scholarly and bureaucratic ideas not merely reflect but also shape lived realities? How do lived realities affect the ways in which categories are named and understood? In addressing such questions, categories sometimes thought of as stable or timeless emerge as, in fact, contingent and embodied.

The Ancient Table: Archaeology of Cooking and Cuisine
ANTH3663UN
1

Prerequisites: None Humans don’t just eat to live. The ways we prepare, eat, and share our food is a complex reflection of our histories, environments, and ideologies. Whether we prefer coffee or tea, cornbread or challah, chicken breast or chicken feet, our tastes are expressive of social ties and social boundaries, and are linked to ideas of family and of foreignness. How did eating become such a profoundly cultural experience? This seminar takes an archaeological approach to two broad issues central to eating: First, what drives human food choices both today and in the past? Second, how have social forces shaped practices of food acquisition, preparation, and consumption (and how, in turn, has food shaped society)? We will explore these questions from various evolutionary, physiological, and cultural viewpoints, highlighted by information from the best archaeological and historic case studies. Topics that will be covered include the nature of the first cooking, beer-brewing and feasting, writing of the early recipes, gender roles and ‘domestic’ life, and how a national cuisine takes shape. Through the course of the semester we will explore food practices from Pleistocene Spain to historic Monticello, with particular emphasis on the earliest cuisines of China, Mesoamerica, and the Mediterranean.

The Politics of Care
ANTH3665UN
1
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

Semester:

What are the consequences of entrenched inequalities in the context of care? How might we (re)imagine associated practices as political projects? Wherein lie the origins of utopic and dystopic visions of daily survival? How might we track associated promises and failures as they travel across social hierarchies, nationalities, and geographies of care? And what do we mean when we speak of “care”? These questions define the scaffolding for this course. Our primary goals throughout this semester are threefold.  First, we begin by interrogating the meaning of “care” and its potential relevance as a political project in medical and other domains. Second, we will track care’s associated meanings and consequences across a range of contents, including urban and rural America, an Amazonia borderland, South Africa, France, and Mexico. Third, we will address temporal dimensions of care, as envisioned and experienced in the here-and-now, historically, and in a futuristic world of science fiction. Finally, and most importantly, we will remain alert to the relevance of domains of difference relevant to care, most notably race, gender, class, and species.

Upper level seminar; 4 points

Summer:

What do we mean when we speak of “care”? How might we (re)imagine practices of care as political and moral projects? What promises, paradoxes, or failures surface amid entrenched inequalities? And what hopes, desires, and fears inform associated utopic and dystopic visions of daily survival? These questions will serve as a scaffolding of sorts for this course, and our primary goals are fourfold. First, we will begin by interrogating the meaning of “care” and its potential relevance as a political project in medical and other domains. Second, we will track care’s associated meanings and consequences across a range of contents, communities, and geographies of care. Third, we will remain alert to the temporal dimensions of care, as envisioned and experienced historically, in the here-and-now, and in the futuristic world of science fiction. Finally, we will consider the moral underpinnings of intra-human alongside interspecies care.

THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF WAR
ANTH3828UN
1
In this class, we will think about the various ways in which philosophers, social theorists, historians and anthropologists have thought about war, violence, and responsibility. The course focuses on a set of themes and questions: for example, the nature of violence and the question of responsibility or accountability, shifting technologies of warfare, and the phenomenology and aftermath of warfare, for civilians and for combatants. The reading list incorporates different approaches to such questions—from historical to philosophical to ethnographic accounts.

While the existence of processes of anthropogenic climate change is well established, predictions regarding the future consequences of these processes are far less certain. In no area is the uncertainty regarding near and long term effects as pronounced as in the question of how climate change will affect global migration. This course will address the issue of climate migration in four ways. First, the course will examine the theoretical and empirical literatures that have elucidated the nature of international migration in general. Second, the course will consider the phenomena of anthropogenic climate change as it relates to migration. Third, the course will consider how human rights and other legal regimes do or do not address the humanitarian issues created by anthropogenic climate change. Fourth, the course will synthesize these topics by considering how migration and climate change has arisen as a humanitarian, political, and economic issue in the Pacific. Human Rights elective.

Sustainability Focused

This architectural design studio explores material assemblies, techniques of fabrication, and systems of organization. These explorations will be understood as catalysts for architectural analysis and design experimentation.

Both designed objects and the very act of making are always embedded within a culture, as they reflect changing material preferences, diverse approaches to durability and obsolescence, varied understandings of comfort, different concerns with economy and ecology. They depend on multiple resources and mobilize varied technological innovations. Consequently, we will consider that making always involves making a society, for it constitutes a response to its values and a position regarding its technical and material resources. Within this understanding, this studio will consider different cultures of making through a number of exercises rehearse design operations at different scales—from objects to infrastructures.

This architectural design studio course explores modes of visualization, technologies of mediation and environmental transformations. These explorations will be used as catalysts for architectural analysis and design experimentation.

Introducing design methodologies that allow us to see and to shape environmental interactions in new ways, the studio will focus on how architecture may operate as a mediator – an intermediary that negotiates, alters or redirects multiple forces in our world: physical, cultural, social, technological, political etc. The semester will progress through three projects that examine unique atmospheric, spatial and urban conditions with the aid of multimedia visual techniques; and that employ design to develop creative interventions at the scales of an interface, space and city.

MOD ARCHITECTURE IN THE WORLD
ARCH3117UN

Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

Note: Designed for but not limited to sophomores; enrollment beyond 60 is at the discretion of the instructor. Co-requisite: ARCH UN3118. 

How has architecture been “modern”? This course will introduce students to this contentious and contradictory concept emerging across the world during a time in which ideas and tools similar to ours were used for seeing and ordering constructed environments and architectural thinking. It introduces students to the history of modern architecture as an art of building as well as a discursive field, whose historical consciousness played a part in its historical development.

The course is structured chronologically and encourages experiential learning around episodes that informed the development of the built environment and the architecturally “modern.” Students will gain hands-on practice in researching and writing architectural history, theory, and criticism: skills that lie at the basis of conceptual architectural practices. While a one-semester course will not provide a full survey of buildings, events, and people associated with modern architecture, students will develop the critical tools to identify, approach, and comprehend such histories. The following areas of focus anchor the course, and students learn about each by understanding the establishment and institution of structures nourishing and supporting them, which have persisted into the present:

Architecture as made, thought, and taught—enmeshed with power and ideas, social concerns, intellectual and public debates, and diverse forms of cultural production

Makers, thinkers, and organizers of the designed or built environment

Designed constructions as the material ends and means of extraction, refinement, trade, and the labor associated with each

Sites, institutions, media, events, and practices that have come to hold meaning in architectural discourse

Concerns with both the past and the future as a basis for architectural theory

Modernization, modernism, and modernity as drivers for events, their historical narration, and the dissemination of these architectural narratives

The conceptual writing practices of history, theory, and criticism

The course is designed to accommodate multiple styles of learning. Course components include weekly lectures and discussions of assigned readings; research and writing assignments designed so that students may pursue individual interests and develop a variety of skills; shared visits to archives; and individual and small group visits to museums. This course has no prerequisites, but demands critical thinking and reading skills.

City, Landscape, Ecology is a thematically driven course that centers on issues and polemics related to landscape, land settlement and ecology over the past two centuries. The class looks at changing attitudes to the natural world from the eighteenth century to the present, tracing important historical shifts in the consideration of nature across the ecological sciences, conservation practices, landscape design, and environmental activism, law and policy. Lectures focus on the critical role that artists and architects have played, and are to play, in making visible the sources of environmental degradation and in developing new means of mitigating anthropogenic ecological change.

City, Landscape, Ecology is divided into three parts. Part I explores important episodes in the history of landscape: picturesque garden theory, notions of “wilderness” as epitomized in national and state parks in the United States, Modern and Postmodern garden practices, and place of landscape in the work of artists from the 1960s to the present. The purpose here is to better understand the role that territorial organization plays in the construction of social practices, human subjectivities, and technologies of power. Lectures in this part are shaped around a dialectical pair of historical episodes–– for example, the picturesque garden is paired with the enclosure of the commons, and American national parks are discussed in relation to the systematic removal of native peoples.

We then turn to ecology and related issues of climate, urbanization and sustainability in Part II. Here we will look at the rise of ecological thinking in the 1960s; approaches to the environment that were based on the systems-thinking approach of the era. In the session “Capitalism, Race and Population Growth” we examine the history of the “crisis” of scarcity from Thomas Robert Malthus, to Paul R. Ehrlich (The Population Bomb, 1968) to today and look at questions of environmental racism, violence and equity. 

The course concludes with Part III on Environmental Repair. At this important juncture in the course, we will ask what is to be done today. We’ll examine the work of contemporary theorists, architects, landscape architects, policy makers and environmentalists who have channeled some of the lessons of the past in proposing lasting solutions to our land management and ecological crises of the present and future.

The Just City: Global Debates in Urban Planning and Policy
ARCH4300GU
1
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

Urbanization is inherently unequal, inscribing social, economic, environmental, and political unevenness into the spatial fabric of the city. But the distribution of such inequality is not inevitable. Urbanization is a product of the collective decisions we make (or choose not to make) in response to the shared challenges we face in our cities. And, thus, the patterns of urbanization can be changed. This is the task of urban planning and the starting point for this advanced seminar, which asks how we can reshape our cities to be more just—to alleviate inequality rather than compound it. In embarking on this effort, we face numerous “wicked” problems without clear-cut solutions. The approaches one takes in addressing urban inequality are therefore fundamentally normative—they are shaped by one’s place in the world and one’s view of it. The central challenge in addressing inequality is thus establishing a basis for collective action amongst diverse actors with differing—and sometimes conflicting—values and views. In other words, planning the just city a matter of both empathy and debate. In this course, we will endeavor to develop informed positions that can help us engage with others as a basis for taking collective action.

The course is organized into four 3-week modules, each of which addresses a dimension of the just city: equity, democracy, diversity, and sustainability. In the first week of each module, we will discuss how the issue has been understood in history and theory (with an emphasis on tradeoffs between different priorities and values); in the second week, we will apply this discussion to a global case study prepared and presented by a team of students; and in the third week, we will hold an in-class debate to determine what should be done. Specific case studies vary each year.

INTRO TO ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION
ASCM2003UN
1
Satisfies Global Core Requirement (Columbia College and General Studies)

This course offers an introduction to the intellectual, social, political, and cultural formations resulting from the revelation of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century until around 1800 CE. It is a “civilization” course and is introductory in nature. It is not a course in Islamic history, religion, philosophy, art, science, or literature, although all of these will be considered in various ways throughout the semester. The intent of the course is to survey the structures, themes, keywords, and subjects that are of interest for the study of Islamic societies, and to encounter a sampling of the historical sources that inform such surveys. Whether through documents, letters, sermons, explanations, publications, songs, or literature, the intention is to use historical sources in order to illuminate our understanding of the events of the past, and in particular, to help the student evaluate narratives about the past for themselves.
The course consists of a lecture and a recitation. All students must be registered for and attend both. The lectures will contextualize the required readings and primary sources, and students will participate in discussions about them in recitation. In addition to weekly readings, assignments include a weekly response post (~1 page), a midterm exam and a final exam. All of the course materials are presented in English

AN INTRODUCTION TO BUDDHIST BELIEF AND PRACTICE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
ASRL2034BC
1
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

This course seeks to introduce students to the diversity of doctrines held- and practices performed by Buddhists in Southeast Asia.  By focusing on how specific beliefs and practices are tied to particular locations and particular times we will be able to explore in detail the religious institutions, artistic, architectural, and musical traditions, textual production and legal and doctrinal developments of Buddhism over time and within its socio-historical context. Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore, by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions we will be able to examine how their individual ethical, cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history, economics, politics and material culture. We will concentrate first on the person of the Buddha, his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Mandalay, Myanmar to Phrae, Thailand, and beyond.  From there we touch on the foundational teachings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time. Finally, we focus on the practice of Buddhist ritual, magic and ethics in monasteries and among lay communities across Southeast Asia.  This section will confront the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as “Just-War,” Women’s Rights and Abortion, Material Culture, etc.. While no one semester course could provide a detailed presentation of the beliefs and practices of Southeast Asian Buddhism, my hope is that we will be able to look closely at certain aspects of the tradition by focusing on how they are practiced across the region. While we will focus on the Theravada lineage of Buddhism, we will also look at Mahayana practices in places like Vietnam and Malaysia, as well as Buddhist encounters with Hindu, Muslim, Catholic, and Taoist practices in the region.

WHY DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE?
ASRL3115BC
1
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)
Sustainability Related

This course is an introduction to the field of inquiry called The Problem of Evil, or Theodicy – that is, the investigation of God in the face of evil and suffering in the world.  How do we justify God? How do we reconcile disaster, pain, and suffering with an all-good, all-knowing, all-compassionate God?   This question arises in all religious traditions, but here we will study only four: the Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Hindu traditions, each of which proposes its own array of answers. Our emphasis will be on primary texts from each tradition, with introductory and interpretive secondary sources brought in as supplementary.  These primary sources will be discussed in class, but especially in required section meetings.  A sub-theme of the course is the “pastoral” dimension of answers to the Problem of Evil: to what extent are the answers we study comforting?  This course has been created with the many crises presently afflicting our world – COVID-19, climate change, and the injustice of racism, to name a few – in mind.

Theodosius Dobzhansky—an influential evolutionary biologist who spent much of his career at Columbia University—famously wrote, “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.” Evolution underlies all biodiversity, from the COVID-19 virus to redwood trees, from New York rats to our own bodies and minds. This course introduces students to the evolutionary processes at all scales, from molecular evolution and population genetics within single species, to macro patterns of diversification and evolution in deep time as studies through phylogenies and the fossil record. The overarching goal of the course is for students to gain a solid command of the major concepts in evolutionary theory and how they are interweaved with all life around us.

Learning objectives:

This course will provide a comprehensive foundation in programming methodology for quantitative biology applications that can be readily applied to any programming language. It is recommended for students interested in establishing or expanding their computational biology skillset. After completing this course, students should be able to:

1. Understand and explain the role of numerical and statistical methods in biology

2. Execute numerical computations using a widely-used programming language

3. Recognize common programming motifs that can be readily applied to other widely used languages

4. Design and troubleshoot algorithms to analyze diverse biological data and implement them using functions and scripts

5. Apply statistical programming techniques to model biological systems

6. Generate and interpret diverse plots based on biological datasets

 

Course overview: 

Once a small subfield of biology, computational biology has evolved into a massive field of its own, with computational methods fast becoming a vital toolkit leveraged by biologists across the discipline. As the size and complexity of biological datasets grows, computational methods allow scientists to make sense of these data, scaling quantitative methods to extract meaningful insights that help us better understand ourselves and the living world around us. In this course, we will learn the basics of computer programming in R, a powerful programming language with wide use in the biological sciences. Topics will include a basic introduction to R and the RStudio environment, data types and control structures, reading and writing files in R, data processing and visualization, manipulating common biological datasets; and statistical testing and modeling in R.

Ornithology

Sustainability Related

            You saw a bird today.
            You saw a bird yesterday.
            You will surely see a bird tomorrow. Without knowing you, or knowing what you do with your days, I know this for a fact about you.

            Unless they are under absolute confinement, chances are that every human being anywhere on the planet will see at least one bird every day. Birds are everywhere. They are mostly diurnal, they fly and they vocalize. Probably more so than any other kind of animal, this makes birds particularly conspicuous and appealing to humans.

            But when you saw a bird today, did you really see it? Did it register at all? Probably not—no more than a passing car or cloud or a stranger in the sidewalk. That’s a shame, because birds have shaped modern biology more than any other group, inspiring discoveries in ecology, evolution, and behavior. They also move billions of dollars each year through birdwatching.

            The overarching goal of this class is for you to start really seeing birds for the wondrous animals that they are and all that they have taught us about biology. This will include identifying and naming bird species, having the basic vocabulary to talk about birds, and relating your bird observations in the field to conceptual knowledge about their evolution and ecology.

            Towards that goal, students will participate in a combination of lectures, readings, group discussions, written assignments, and group and solo outings to observe birds in Central Park. Topics addressed will include: evolutionary origins of birds; bird systematics and classification; the biology of feathers; bioacoustics and birdsong; the biology of migration; bird reproductive behavior; and bird conservation.

This course explores the intersections of identity and power in the ancient Mediterranean, with a focus on how race and ethnicity were constructed in the art, literature, and material culture of Greece and Rome. We will consider a broad range of texts including epic, ethnographies, medical texts, dramas, novels, and material evidence to examine how ancient Mediterranean peoples articulated and conceived of foreignness and difference. In our considerations of these texts we will discuss ancient theories of ethnic and racial superiority, narratives of belonging and exclusion and how these intersected with political and social control, as well as linguistic, religious and cultural differentiation as a basis for ethnic differentiation. We will also analyze ancient racism through the prism of a variety of social processes in antiquity, such as slavery, trade and colonization, migrations, imperialism, assimilation, and native revolts. By the end of the course, students will have gained a richer understanding of the intellectual and cultural history of the ancient Mediterranean world and will be able to engage in discussions of identity construction in a comparative manner.

An Odyssey of Odysseys: Receptions of the Odyssey from Antiquity to the 21st Century
CLLT3129UN
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

Homer’s Odyssey, likely composed around the 9 th or 8 th century BCE, has had an enduring legacy. Our journey this semester will bring us into contact with a varied selection of artistic endeavors, spanning different cultures, times, and media, that draw on the Odyssey for material or inspiration. A guiding set of broadly-formulated questions will steer our course: Can we find in the Odyssey some of the same meaning, today, that it held for its original audience and that it held, subsequently, for later Greeks? Do receptions of the Odyssey try to recapture it, reframe it, refashion it, or become something independent?  (Are these mutually exclusive options?) How
do we read these works in light of the Odyssey, and also how do we re-visit and re-read the Odyssey in light of its receptions? It is no secret that the present bears the enduring weight of the past, but is the past changed as a result? There is no requirement to have read the Odyssey previously: students who have read it or have not read it will approach the course in different, but equally fruitful, ways.

Dreaming Empire: Britain & Russia in 19C

1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

The course falls neatly into two halves, addressing the British and Russian empires as they were in the 19th century. The purpose of the course is to become familiar with imperial thinking, the thought (pro-empire, anti-empire, and simply permeated by empire, to put it in terms familiar to a contemporary audience) implicit in various literary works of the time. For the most part, the readings assigned are primary texts. These will be heavily supplemented during course meetings: the instructor will bring in various materials that would be obscure if assigned to students outside of class, but with live explanations in-class, will enrich their understanding of the primary readings.

Most readings are literary texts, though students will also read and receive guidance in secondary academic literature about those works. A few philosophical and historical texts from the time under examination will also be assigned.

Introduction to Cognitive Science
COGS1001UN
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)

The goal of cognitive science — and of this course — is to understand how the mind works. Trying to understand our own minds is perhaps the most ambitious and exciting (and difficult) project in all of science, and this project requires tools drawn from fields including experimental psychology, computer science and artificial intelligence, linguistics, vision science, philosophy, anthropology, behavioral economics, and several varieties of neuroscience (among others). This course will introduce you to the major tools and theories from these areas, as they relate to the study of the mind. We will employ these perspectives while exploring the nature of mental processes such as perception, reasoning, memory, attention, imagery, language, intelligence, decision-making, morality— and even attraction and love. In sum, this course will expose you to cognitive science, the assumptions on which it rests, and many of the most important and fascinating results obtained so far.

Language, Meaning, and Mind
COGS3950UN
1 section

In little more than fifty years linguistics has shifted from philological description to a cognitive-biological quest to uncover the mind’s language faculty. This seminar traces that shift through the generative tradition, which treats language as an innate “mental organ” whose universal grammar lets children build a full syntax from sparse input. We follow Minimalism’s bold reduction: a single operation called Merge, plus a finite lexicon and two interfaces, one to articulation and one to thought, yields the “digital infinity” of human expression. Framing this architecture in evolutionary terms, we confront Darwin’s problem: did language emerge gradually for communication or erupt suddenly from pre-existing cognitive parts? Evidence from birdsong, primate calls, and gesture helps separate general performance limits from the species-specific competence that remains uniquely human. Students will practice minimalist analyses and weigh competing biolinguistic accounts, using language as a window onto the design and origin of the human mind.

Computational Models of Decision-Making
COGS3951UN
1 section
Satisfies 3 credit Science Lecture or Lab Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Quantitatively and Empirically" Requirement (Barnard)

We make decisions countless times a day. Computational models have been developed that improve our understanding of how these decisions are made. This course is organized in three parts: perceptual decision-making, value-based decision-making, and computational psychiatry. In part one, perceptual decision-making, we will focus on computational models that can capture and explain decisions in perception, such as categorizing an orientation, or discriminating the direction of moving dots, or estimating the magnitude of a stimulus (e.g., time). We will start by laying the foundations of signal detection theory and Bayesian inference under uncertainty and build to models that incorporate confidence ratings and reaction times. In part two, value-based decision-making, we will move on to decisions that incorporate our values (e.g., ‘Should I go out or stay in and study?’, ‘Should I eat a burger or a salad?’). We will learn the basics of a computational modeling framework that captures how we learn values from rewards and punishments, reinforcement learning, as well as about model-free and model-based learning. Lastly, we will learn how impairments in decision-making that occur in psychopathology (e.g., addiction, anorexia nervosa, anxiety) have been conceptualized and quantified in the relatively new field of computational psychiatry.

In this course, we work together to understand and address the challenges of misinformation, disinformation, and strategic manipulation in online environments. Students develop a deep understanding of the problem space from an information and social justice perspective by reading and discussing research—both historical and contemporary—on how and why misinformation and disinformation spread. Alongside this, we explore the process, both personal and interpersonal, by which these issues can be approached and addressed in our own lives. This will involve reflecting on our own presuppositions, beliefs, and biases about information; and doing a project in which we apply the principles of Human-Centered Design to investigate different design directions for addressing misleading information. Through this, students gain important contextual knowledge and hands-on design experience that they can take into future professional domains (from education to policy to technology), where they can contribute to building more trustworthy information systems.

In this course, we explore the variety of roles that computation can play in the analysis, creation, and performance of music. We start with the fundamentals of sound in the digital domain, covering issues of representation and audio synthesis. We then move through various synthesis techniques including the additive, subtractive, frequency modulation (FM), and amplitude modulation (AM) synthesis. After covering some core DSP techniques, we put these concepts into performative practice by exploring “live coding”. In the space of live coding, we examine various programming language designs to understand how various domain specific languages (DSLs) support live coding. For the third module, we turn our focus to automated composition and analysis, addressing challenges in music information retrieval, generative art, and autonomous improvisation systems. All the while, we continue to develop our fluency in live coding by putting new topics to practice.

LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS: FOUNDATIONS AND ETHICS
COMS3707BC
1 section
Satisfies "Thinking Quantitatively and Empirically" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Technologically and Digitally" Requirement (Barnard)

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, ChatGPT, LLaMA are models that are trained on large amounts of data and are adaptable to a wide range of tasks. They are the basis of most state-of-the-art systems in Natural Language Processing. While the potential of these technologies for social good is large, the risks are also comparable. In this course, the students will learn the fundamentals about the modeling, theory and ethical aspects of LLMs and their applications, while gaining experience working with them. The course will be structured as a seminar, where one class is dedicated to instructor-led lecture and one to studentled discussion of papers around topics covered in the lecture. Each paper discussion will be structured as a panel of 3-4 students, each with an assigned role. Each panel role covers one aspect of critically assessing an academic/industry paper. Everyone in the class should participate by commenting and asking questions from the panel. The class is project-based, meaning there will be a semester-long project focused on evaluating LLMs and/or building LLMs around a topic/problem/task you care about, with an end of semester final paper. The projects will be done by groups of 3-4 students.

Prerequisite(s): COMS W3134 or W3136 or W3137 (or equivalent). Background in probability/statistics and linear algebra is also required and experience with Python programming is strongly encouraged. Some previous or concurrent exposure to NLP, AI or machine learning is beneficial, but not required.

1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

The course introduces students to animal studies, a multidisciplinary field that investigates relations
between human and nonhuman animals across historical periods, political regimes, cultural contexts, and
institutional settings. Beginning with the foundational concepts of animal studies and moving toward
contemporary debates, the course traces how animals have been mediated through philosophy, science,
and law, as well as cultural artifacts. Through readings of classic and contemporary texts—from Aristotle,
Descartes, and Bentham to Peter Singer, Carol J. Adams, and Donna J. Haraway—the course examines
how ideas concerning animal nature, moral worth, legal status, and political inclusion are produced,
contested, and transformed.

CPLT3000BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Technologically and Digitally" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

This course explores the photographic essay as a distinct visual language. We will examine how photographic artists and photojournalists use sequences of images to construct narratives that communicate complex ideas about the past. In an age when nearly everyone carries a camera to capture the present, many photographers have turned their lenses toward the past to illuminate personal histories and collective memories. Through weekly seminars, we will explore how contemporary photographers around the world challenge national narratives and reimagine history. We will consider how photography—often seen as the medium most bound to the present—can evoke what is absent or lost. Focusing on artists from Asia, Africa, Latin America, North America, and the Middle East, we will explore how their work engages collective memory in relation to dictatorship, state violence, and contested histories. Finally, we will investigate how artists have used re-enactment, commemoration, re-imaging, and inclusive archiving to engage with history and memory through visual practice.

DERRIDA & LITERATURE
CPLT3145BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Sustainability Related

Jacques Derrida was one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century and his impact on literary studies was enormously significant. The objective of this course is to take stock of Derrida’s contribution to literature, and to do so by assessing the intricate relations he establishes between literature, philosophy, economic and political theory, gender studies, translation studies, postcolonial theory, and theology. The course is divided into six parts. Part 1 introduces Derrida’s approach to ‘deconstruction,’ particularly as regards his engagement with the fundamental concepts of Western thought and the importance he confers upon the notion of ‘writing’ itself. Part 2 examines Derrida’s autobiographical texts wherein he positions himself as a subject for deconstruction, interrogating his own gender, his sense of being an organic, creaturely life-form, the relationship he has to his own language, and the matter of his identity as French, but also as Algerian, and Jewish. While the majority of the Derrida texts we will be reading are excerpts from larger works or short essays and interviews, in this section we will read a full-length text – Monolingualism of the Other – so that we can trace Derrida’s train of thought from beginning to end. In Part 3 we will use an interview conducted by Derek Attridge, “This Strange Institution Called Literature,” as a template for thinking about Derrida’s relation to literature, and in Part 4 we will read our second full-length text by Derrida, namely Given Time 1: Counterfeit Money, an in-depth analysis of a prose poem by the French poet Charles Baudelaire. Part 5 considers an aspect of Derrida’s work that reveals the extent of his embrace of provisional, in-between positions for thought in general, and for literary texts in particular, namely translation. For deconstruction is keenly invested in words beginning with ‘trans’: transposition, transplant, trans-valuation, and indeed trans-gender. Translation provides Derrida with a scenario whereby crossings and transits can be imagined – for literary texts, and for identities that wish to remain un-determined by fixed poles or normative values. The course finishes with an assessment of Derrida’s reflections on death, mourning, and the matter of leaving a legacy. In Part 6, we therefore read more of the essay “Living On,” and also Derrida’s final interview, “Learning to Live, Finally.” Not even Derrida could deconstruct away the finality of death, but he did hope to live on. My corresponding hope is that you will feel sufficiently attuned to Derrida’s thought that you consider it important to continue his legacy – to be one of the agents of his living on, survival or survie, a translator and transporter of his thought towards contexts that he could not have foreseen, but which he would doubtless have welcomed as a precious chance for his own work to be considered differently. Taking intellectual risks, thinking otherwise, and inventing new ways of knowing are, after all, the hallmarks of Derridean deconstruction.

This course traces the origins of the expansive, non-stop processes of 21st-century capitalism and contemporary technological culture in the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th century.  It examines how British and German Romantic poets and critics, working between literature and philosophy, figured the crises of community occasioned by such processes in terms of a crisis of resonance, creating a poetics and ethics of resonance whereby we may re-attune ourselves to ourselves and each other in a world that often feels radically out of sync.  Beyond British and European Romanticism, we will study the global repercussions of a poetics and ethics of resonance in the writing of literary modernity in texts from East Asia and South Asia.  Readings include works of literature and art by William Wordsworth, Coleridge, Schiller, Schlegel, Feng Menglong, Hu Shih, Zhou Zuoren, Nirala, Chekhov, Murakami, and Hamaguchi, and philosophical and theoretical texts by Plato, Freud, Jacques Lacan, J. L. Austin, Raymond Williams, Charles Taylor, Hartmut Rosa, Paul de Man, Geoffrey Hartman, Cathy Caruth, and others.

Maurice Blanchot once described translators as the “hidden masters of culture.” Indeed, though our labor and craft often go unrecognized in the age of Google Translate, translators play an essential role as tastemakers, bridge-builders, advocates, and diplomats, not to mention the most intimate readers and re-writers of literature. In this workshop, we will explore translation as a praxis of writing, reading, and revision. Together, we will also interrogate translation's complex and often fraught role in cultural production. What ethical questions does translation raise? Who gets to translate, and what gets translated? What is the place of the translator in the text? What can translation teach us about language, literature, and ourselves? Readings will include selections from translation theory, method texts, and literary translations across genres, from poetry and prose to essay and memoir. Students will workshop original translations into English and complete brief writing and translation exercises throughout.

The Arabic Novel
CPLT3552BC
1 section

The novel in Arabic literature has often been the place where every attempt to look within ends up involving the need to contend with or measure the self against the European, the dominant culture. This took various forms. From early moments of easy-going and confident cosmopolitan travellers, such as Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, to later author, such as Tayeb Salih, mapping the existential fault lines between west and east. For this reason, and as well as being a modern phenomenon, the Arabic novel has also been a tool for translation, for bridging gaps and exposing what al-Shidyaq—the man credited with being the father of the modern Arabic novel, and himself a great translator—called ‘disjunction’. We will begin with his satirical, deeply inventive and erudite novel, published in 1855, Leg Over Leg. It is a book with an insatiable appetite for definitions and comparisons, with Words that had been lost or fell out of use (the author had an abiding interest in dictionaries that anticipates Jorge Louis Borges) and with locating and often subverting moments of connection and disconnection. We will then follow along a trajectory to the present, where we will read, in English translation, novels written in Arabic, from Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Morocco and Palestine. We will read them chronologically, starting with Leg Over Leg (1855) and finishing with Minor Detail, a novel that was only published last year.  Obviously, this does not claim to be a comprehensive survey; for that we would need several years and even then, we would fall short. Instead, the hope is that it will be a thrilling journey through some of the most facinating fiction ever written. Obviously, this does not claim to be a comprehensive survey; for that we would need several years and even then, we would fall short.

AFRICAN DANCE I
DNCE2252BC
2 sections

In West Africa, dance is part of daily life. It is used to mark occasions such a birth, death, harvest, and  marriage. It is also used to unite the community in times of crisis. West African dance is not as much a strict  technique as it is a movement coming from the spirit and the rhythm of the drum and the energy of the  people. While there are certain steps that go with specific rhythms, it leaves space for the individual  interpretation and improvisations which is an important element. Dancing is more about the communication  between dancer and drummer. The movement of West African dance tends to be energetic and big. It is very  expressive, and the energy is outward. 

Some African dance steps are taken directly from daily activities such as planting or hunting. Most, however,  are an expression of joy or release of the spirit. Dancing is done by communicating with a drummer to create  positive energy. It is a way to enjoy oneself and each other. In African dance, the name of the dance is the  same as the name of the rhythm played by the drummer. The individual steps that make up the dance do not  have names. In this course, we are going to be learning various West African dances such as Sikko, Socco,  Kuku, Mandiany, Farakorroba, Sunu, Soli, Lamba, Mandjo, Diambadong, Doundounba, Kaolask,  Thieboudjeune, Niarry---gorong, Ekongkong, Wolossodong, Zaouly, Ngorong, Niakka, Maraka, Djansa and  Lengeng/Kutiro.

Moving with the Voice
DNCE2456BC
1 section

Moving with the Voice is an interdisciplinary creative exploration using the voice, improvised and created music, dance, and theater.  Students will explore extended vocal techniques, gesture, character and musical structures (e.g. hockets, rounds, rhythms, deconstructions) within both a solo and ensemble framework, composing their own soundscapes and creating their own voice/movement/theater work through improvisation and in-class assignments. Certain assignments will be inspired by the work of Meredith Monk or the percussion show Stomp.

Open to all levels of experience. A willingness to sing is required.

FROM PAGE TO STAGE: DANCE & LITERATURE
DNCE3000BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

This course explores how dance and other forms of embodied performance adapt literature, as well as how dance serves as inspiration for the written word. What is retained, what is lost, and what is enhanced when moving bodies enliven literature, or when literature seeks to capture the motions of dance? How does choreography transform the constituent parts of literature, from characters and plot to the rhythms of language? How do words and movement collaborate to tell the stories of such disparate figures as lovers, monsters, migrants, and robots, and in modes that range from the pastoral to the autobiographical to the comic? To answer these and other questions, we will read short fiction, plays, and poems, focused largely on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; and watch numerous genres of dance, including ballet, experimental dance, dance-theater, musical theater, hip hop, silent film, and puppetry. To explore the conceptual relationship of body and text, students will gain introductory exposure to theories of narrative, performance, adaptation, and more. "Page to Stage" welcomes, and is geared toward, students from any disciplinary background.

CLASSIC VARIATIONS
DNCE3143BC
1 section

Variations class is a course for the intermediate to advanced dancer.  As in all other ballet classes, there will be a focus on correct physical alignment, proper technique and musicality.  The added challenges in this course will be the pointe shoe technique, creative choreographic choices, and musical phrasing. The class will include variations based on works ranging from Petipa to Balanchine to today’s choreographers.  Dancers will explore personalizing already known works, pushing the boundaries of the pointe shoe, examining how choreography has evolved and developing the stamina required to execute a full variation. Learning material rapidly while paying attention to the stylistic demands of each choreographer’s works and being able to shift from one stylistic choice to another is simply expected.

This contemporary technique class invites students into an embodied practice focusing on a daily physical experimentation and challenge. Emphasis will be placed on corporeal ways to explore questions around propelling, listening, connecting, healing, and action. This course offers a chance for students to use their sensatorial experience to reflect on individual pathways/ desires for expression while, challenging the body to take risks and practice as their movement knowledge expands. Emphasis on sensation, initiation, and weight will be introduced in a floor or standing warm-up that will expand to a standing exploration of the transition between form and space. A focus will be to continue our development of a strong-grounded technique with healthy placement that moves with ease in and out of the floor. We will continue to develop our true embodied relationship to environment, people, and time.

CONTACT IMPROVISATION
DNCE3338BC
1 section

Prerequisites: Limited to twenty people. Examination of the gender-neutral partnering technique that is now common in contemporary dance. Focus is placed on recent improvisatory forms, sensation building, center connection and risk. Emphasis is placed on listening and sensing rather than controlling or leading.

This course will introduce the exploration of a partnering technique that is enriching for the mind and body. Contact Improvisation is not only an important tool for the dancer as it informs the body how to move with weight and connection and is required by most contemporary styles – it is also a technique that informs the artist in us all as it emphasizes listening, trust, and spontaneous creativity. In this course, students will use contact to support the creation of most duets, trios, and larger group dance.   Focus is placed on recent improvisatory forms, sensation building, center connection, and finding the safe edges of risk as well as applying these studies to creation and expression. Students in this course will explore their own weight and how it relates to other bodies by listening as well as employing emotional, psychological, and cultural structures to their improvisation. Emphasis is placed on listening and sensation rather than controlling or leading. Students will explore the dynamic ride and risk taking of improvisation and trusting another body by giving and taking weight. Contact Improvisation is open to all students.

Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

This course will use films to introduce Chinese contemporary history, culture, and values. As the first part of this course, it focuses primarily on films produced in mainland China. Students will explore a selection of films from the early 1930s to the present, spanning various genres and themes, including internationally renowned Chinese films, independent productions, and mainstream popular works, while also reflecting diverse customs and dialects. Through this exploration, students will develop a foundational understanding of China’s contemporary history, society, and its rich and diverse cultural traditions and values.

CULTURE, MENTAL HEALTH, AND HEALING IN EAST ASIA

1 section
Satisfies Global Core Requirement (Columbia College and General Studies)
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

Why do certain mental illnesses only appear in specific regions of the world? What processes of translation, adaption, and “indigenization” take place when psychiatric diagnostic categories, pharmaceutical regimens, and psychodynamic treatments developed in the West travel to China, Japan and South Korea? How do contemporary East Asian therapeutic modalities destabilize biomedical assumptions about the origins and treatment of mental illness?

This course employs anthropological analysis to explore the paradoxes of “culture-bound syndromes”, examine how biomedical psychiatric practices have been received and transformed, and discuss the ways in which shamanistic rituals and Traditional Chinese Medicine clinical encounters understand their objects of intervention. Focusing on East Asia with a particular emphasis on China, we will employ interpretive and political economic anthropological analyses to explore experiences of people struggling with illness, the practices of health practitioners who treat them, and the broader social and historical contexts that shape these interactions.

Love, Labor, and Leisure in Contemporary China
EAAS4231GU
1 section

This course takes an anthropological perspective on life in China today with special attention to the legacies of the country’s socialist past. We start with a brief look at the ideological and institutional frameworks employed by the Communist Party to organize the daily life of its citizens in the decades leading into the People’s Republic. We will then read about how economic and social reforms instituted since the 1980s, in particular changes to the work unit and household registration system, have resulted in dramatically different opportunities and expectations for Chinese citizens attempting to navigate career opportunities, search for romantic partners, move through communal and private spaces and engage in consumptive activities. Exploring the experiences of rural peasants, urban workers, and laborers who move between countryside and city as well as between nations, we will examine how class, gender, and sexuality come to be refigured as China integrates into the global market economy. Scholarly texts will be supplemented with political speeches, short work of fiction and essays, and films.

ACCOUNTING & FINANCE FOR ECONOMICS
ECON2261UN
2 sections
Satisfies "Thinking Quantitatively and Empirically" Requirement (Barnard)

The purpose of this course is to provide a basic introduction to accounting, including the
foundations of accounting concepts, the underlying mechanics, and the overall perspective required
to become intelligent users of accounting information. The course will focus on the main
financial statements, the nature of accrual measurement, and the information perspective. In addition,
we will explore some accounting methods in detail, such as revenue recognition, assets,
liabilities, and equity.
The overarching perspective is that accounting reports provide information that is useful for
a variety of purposes. In the course, I will also provide insights into how the financial markets
use accounting information to evaluate executives, predict future stock returns, assess firms’
riskiness, and allocate society’s resources to their most productive uses.

The course is an introduction to the economic developments that gave rise to capitalist economies and economic globalization from 1500 to the 20th century. We apply economic and empirical reasoning to examine many transformations that have shaped the economies of the modern era—demographic, technological, and institutional changes. We compare the rise of Europe and other Eurasian civilizations, especially China. We examine the role of slavery and imperialism in global economic integration. We examine how the rise of modern capitalism influenced human material well-being and conflict and has led to the convergence and divergence of nations in the global economy.

Economics of Work and Play
ECON3081BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Sustainability Related

In 1930 Keynes predicted a 15-hour work week by the 21st century because he expected we would be at the foothills of the "economic promised land." He was more than right about technological progress and staggering productivity growth –– but dead wrong about the role work would play in our lives. Here we are, working 40+ hour weeks in mostly drab jobs, often under precarious employment conditions. 

 

This course is centered on the concept of "work." The broad objectives of the course are: first, to facilitate a critical understanding of the meaning and significance of work for human life; second, to develop a set of theoretical and analytical tools to dissect and analyze specific work arrangements that we in fact encounter in the real world; and third, and perhaps more importantly, to imagine alternative arrangements of work life that might be better suited for human flourishing. 

 

We begin with some of the central ideas in modern labor economics, including definition of work, labor supply and demand, market mechanisms of wage determination, human capital theory and incentive-based management. We then assess the underlying assumptions implied in this body of knowledge –– for example, from labor as input in production to profit maximization and utility maximization based on stable consumer preferences over material goods and services and leisure time. The springboard for this critical analysis is a set of alternative viewpoints on what constitutes "work activity" from various other academic disciplines including philosophy, anthropology, linguistics and psychology. These readings, with their origins in different historical and intellectual settings and founded on different conceptions of human nature, stand in sharp contrast to this neoclassical economic view of "man" and "work.”

 

The course will have a two-part structure. The first half of the course will consist of a series of lectures on modern labor economic models emphasizing the assumptions, theories and labor market “facts” that these models are designed to explain. The second half of the course will shift to a more discussion-based format that is better suited to a close "exegesis" of the required texts as critique of this neoclassical paradigm of work.

INCLUSIVE APPROACHES TO TEACHING LITERACY: THEORY AND PRACTICE
EDUC3025BC
1 section

This seminar engages students in an exploration of how schools prepare students to be literate across multiple subject areas. Engaging students with theory and practice, we will look at how students learn to read and write, considering approaches for literacy instruction from early childhood through adolescence. Understanding that schools are required to meet the needs of diverse learners, we will explore literacy instruction for K-12 students with special needs, multilingual learners, and students from diverse cultural backgrounds. This course requires 60 hours of clinical experience (fieldwork).

Contemporary Issues in Education explores the critical and controversial issues confronting education today, including student well being, diversity, equity, access, technology, teaching methods, the teaching profession, and the future of education. In this course we will identify, explore, discuss, and debate these issues through ongoing, interactive dialogue and film-based activities drawing upon various educational theories, current research, and personal perspectives and experiences. This course is designed for students who intend to work as educators or in related fields; students interested in studying the dialectical relationship between education and major social, political, and/or historical trends; and students in film and media studies who want to explore the documentary film genre, including analysis, critique and production aspects. 


The course will combine a seminar that centers documentary films about education as core texts for analysis and study with a workshop in film techniques to support the production of novel film projects. Students will learn how to read and critique documentary films selected to represent and foster multiple perspectives through their narratives, evidence, arguments, and technical elements. Additional readings will provide a contemporary context for the films and offer additional perspectives. With that said, the goal is not to be exhaustive of the range of perspectives on each issue, rather, they represent a starting point for class discussion and dialogue, and a launch pad for students to make their own short documentary films.

GENDER, SEXUALITY, AND SCHOOL
EDUC3042BC
1 section
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Sustainability Related
Broadly, this course explores the relationship between gender, sexuality, and schooling across national contexts. We begin by considering theoretical perspectives, exploring the ways in which gender and sexuality have been studied and understood in the interdisciplinary field of education. Next, we consider the ways in which the subjective experience of gender and sexuality in schools is often overlooked or inadequately theorized. Exploring the ways that race, class, citizenship, religion and other categories of identity intersect with gender and sexuality, we give primacy to the contention that subjectivity is historically complex, and does not adhere to the analytically distinct identity categories we might try to impose on it.

EDUC3043BC
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

Summer and Semester version:

Making Change: Activism, Social Movements and Education will look at the ways people power has pushed for change in the United States educational landscape. We will study historical and current social political education movements to answer questions such as: What does education/teacher activism look like? Who engages in educational social activism, and why? What do different models for organizing look like, past to present? We will learn from the examples of the Freedom Schools, the Chicago Teachers Union, the Tucson Unified School District fight for ethnics studies, BLM at Schools, Teacher Activist Groups and more. We will engage in readings, watch documentaries and hear from education activist guest lecturers.

Learning Outcomes: 

    You will explore the historical relationships between and across social movements in education and its social contexts. 
    You will reflect on major educational justice movements from across the country and analyze its impact and importance. 
    You will evaluate the changing role of education and schools in our society and propose actions that could be taken to improve education and schools in the future.

COMPLICATING CLASS: EDUCATION AND THE LIMITS OF EQUITY
EDUC3045BC
1 section

In this course, we start from the premise that a failure to understand what social class is and how social class matters in daily life stops us from having conversations about the possibilities and limitations of schooling and, as such, prevents us from doing what we can to improve the schooling experiences of poor and working-class students. Throughout the semester, we will work to “complicate class”, reconsidering what class is, why class matters, and how we can best think about the relationship between social class and schooling. You will develop a language for talking about class, considering the affordances and constraints of various conceptions of class. You will also leave with critical questions about the possibilities and limitations of relying on schools as a solution to social problems. Recognizing restraints, we will conclude by reflecting on how we might work toward creating more equitable learning environments for poor and working-class students.

MARKETIZATION & PRIVATIZATION IN EDUCATION
EDUC3048BC
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

It has become commonplace for governments to partner with the private sector to deliver public goods and services; this is seen as a way to increase efficiency and decrease costs. Often, this privatization goes hand in hand with an adoption of market values. Nowhere are these trends more evident – or important – than public education. Arguments for educational privatization are often thought of in terms of economics – does it save money? – or limited measures of student achievement - does it raise test scores? In this course, we acknowledge these questions, but we also go beyond them to explore the political and social dimensions of privatization. We ask: Who wins and who loses when public schools privatize? What happens when market values are normalized and prioritized in our schools?

The following questions frame our explorations:

·How does privatization in education differ from privatization in other sectors? 

·What are the implications of educational privatization and marketization for democracy and the public good?

·Who profits from privatization and how does this support or interfere with educative goals?

·How are philanthropy, venture capital, and corporate partnerships reshaping the way schools serve students?

·Does privatization expand opportunities for marginalized students, deepen existing inequalities, or both?

·How does privatization affect the teacher workforce? How does it affect the nature of teachers’ work and student learning?

·How is privatization proceeding globally? How is privatization linked with global policy spread?

·What forms do resistance to privatization take? What ethical considerations should we take up around privatization?

 

This course includes an empirical research component which provides scaffolding and support for students who eventually plan to write a senior thesis.

Course Overview/Short Description
This course will consider various ways that changing environmental conditions put stress on humans and our societies and political systems, with an emphasis on conditions in the Global South. Among other topics it will consider influences of climate change on violent conflict migration and impacts of heat and air pollution on human health and wellbeing. Students will develop data analysis skills to explore these relationships and complete projects on environmental security cases and questions of their own choosing.

Longer Description/Purpose/Intention of the Course
Variation and shifts in environmental conditions have challenged societies throughout human history. Today, climatic variability and change, along with resource extraction, pollution and other forms of environmental degradation, influence society in myriad ways, through water resources and agriculture, storms, sea level rise, and direct impacts of heat on living things, among others. Moreover, different human populations, across race, ethnicity, class, gender, age, occupation and other lines face different levels of exposure and vulnerability to climatic and other environmental stressors and tend to experience them inequitably. Students will consider the influence and disparate impacts of environmental conditions on human security, through pathways such as human health, food and water security and education; various sectors of the economy from agriculture to mining to manufacturing; governance and social capacities; and broader social and political conditions like conflict, leadership change and migration. We will also consider the various approaches humans are taking to adapt to these stressors, mitigate their harms and build resilience. Throughout, emphasis will be placed on how natural and social scientists studying these phenomena engage in the research process to learn about and detect these impacts and the disparities among them.

This is a highly collaborative and project-based course that aims to offer students the power to choose the resources they want to use and the topics and cases they want to study. There will be no exams, outside of possible brief quizzes to determine whether students are engaging with the course material. Instead, in the first portion of the course, the instructor will guide students through the study of a collection of key topics and cases in environmental security AND the development of key skill sets for gathering and processing data and analyzing environmental security questions. Students will then, in the latter portion of the course, build from this knowledge and use these skills to pursue their own investigations and questions and share what they have learned with the rest of the class. Over the course of the semester, students will
a) identify and share examples of environmental security narratives in popular media, and then assess the accuracy of those narratives,
b) debate and discuss the veracity of claims about climate-related conflicts,
c) find and teach the class about one or more useful datasets for researching environment-security links, and
d) write about and present on case studies: focused on particular countries or regions, or particular varieties (not already covered during the course) of environmental security challenges.
e) The course will culminate with a final project in the form of a research proposal or “pre-analysis plan” (see details below) for assessing one pathway through which environmental stressors are expected to affect human security.

Changing environmental conditions can challenge and harm human beings and our societies in numerous ways. In this class you will build the skills you need to understand, identify and assess those harms and then critically evaluate possible solutions!

BLACK SPECULATIVE FICTION
ENFL3001BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

Black Speculative Fiction encompasses a whole range of Black subgenres from Science Fiction and Fantasy to Horror and Afrofuturism. For the duration of this course, we will attempt to begin the work of extrapolating the function of Blackness within these various genres—interrogating which syntactical elements are required to label a piece of fiction “Black” and how Blackness informs genre. Through formal analysis of texts and the application of various theories presented in class, we’ll begin to understand how Blackness moves through genre to understand its relationship to the world and in some cases, to the artform itself. We will look at various texts: Film, Television, Prose, and Music. By looking across genres, we will be able to honor the inherent intertextuality of Black work and the constant inter-discursive work done across genre, text, and time. Whether a critique of structural anti-Blackness writ large, an expression of the complexity of the positionality of Black persons, or a statement of the function of Blackness, these texts make a case for the theoretical rigor and provocative discourses that lies at the heart of Black Speculative Fiction.

Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

What does it mean to be intelligent? Recent years have seen rapid advances in artificial  intelligence technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning,  comprehension, problem solving, creativity and autonomy. At the same time, we have  become more aware of other forms of intelligence—some which have been with us all along.  Through a selection of fiction and nonfiction texts and films, students will deepen their  understanding of the multifaceted nature of intelligence and the fascinating, uncanny, and  multiple ways of existing on, off, and in the earth.

Ghost Stories
ENGL1045BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

What are ghosts? Why are we haunted by them? And why are we so drawn to telling stories about these hauntings? In this class, we will read ghost stories from the 17th century through the present day; in the process, we will examine what these stories reveal about our own preoccupations, fears, and desires. Writers and readers turn to ghost stories for horror and suspense, for sure, but also because they’re a powerful medium for reckoning with history and memory—with the past’s hold over the present—particularly when it comes to violence, loss, oppression, and trauma. Ghost stories engage with issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality; with social otherness; with marginalization. Ghost stories stage problems of justice, vengeance, and guilt. Ghost stories trouble the nature of the body, and the meaning of (and boundaries between) life and death. Ghost stories lend themselves both to fear and to laughter, both to questions and to answers. While exploring all of these topics and themes, we will also consider the trope of storytelling itself, which figures prominently in so many works of the genre. What is wrapped up in the gesture of telling a story, and in the ways, contexts, and reasons in and for which these stories get told? Readings (subject to change) include works by Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Edith Wharton, Henry James, Shirley Jackson, Helen Oyeyemi, Maxine Hong Kingston, Toni Morrison, Oscar Wilde, and others.

Poetry-ish: Hybridity and Society
ENGL1152BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

Poetry-ish is a class examining how poetry speaks to, merges with, or embeds itself in other
genres in order to make a multimedia social statement. We will look at the intersections between
craft and criticism, audience and experimentation, history and self-expression. Readings will
move from early examples of hybridity to postmodern experimentation to creative examinations
into such contemporary issues as climate change, A.I., and the structural racism that inspired
Black Lives Matter. Genres include legal treaties, programming code, comics, cinema, opera,
jazz, and of course, poetry. Students will be asked to write three short essays, take turns leading
class discussion, submit one longer research-based project, and engage in various creative and
critical writing exercises throughout the semester. Planned authors include Layli Long Soldier,
William Blake, Franny Choi, JP Howard, Vanessa Anglica Villarreal, Douglas Kearney, Daveed
Diggs, and Langston Hughes.

INTIMATE COMPANIONS: READING AND WRITING ABOUT BOTANICALS, ANIMALS, AND PEOPLE
ENGL1246BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

This First-Year course will engage with literary expressions of the universally interesting topic of relationships. Tony Tanner in his Adultery in the Novel characterizes marriage as “the structure which supports all structure.” Contemporary critics have seen marriage as essential to maintaining the “family values” of the bourgeoisie; feminists and Marxists have challenged the economic assumptions of patriarchally-defined marriage. Folklorists have treated marriage as the endpoint of the search for a safe domestic space. We will touch on this subject, but will also turn to writing about other indispensable relationships that, increasingly, fill our lives. Animals and botanicals—and our relationship with nature—have become so obviously  Important in the past ten years that they deserve to underpin our core values, too.

Starting with classic fairy tales and moving on to short fictions, contemporary American poetry, an affectionate study of the psyches of trees, and brief essays on animals we live with, this course will deliver an exportable cluster of ideas that may change our lives.

AI LITERACY IN PRACTICE: FROM UNDERSTANDING TO RESPONSIBLE APPLICATION
ENGL1249BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Technologically and Digitally" Requirement (Barnard)

"I believe in the future of AI changing the world. The question is, who is changing AI? It is really important to bring diverse groups of students and future leaders into the development of AI.”  --Fei-Fei Li, Professor, Denning Co-Director Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI

Increasing numbers of AI experts and researchers emphasize the urgent need for college students to develop AI literacy, preparing them for evolving job markets, fostering ethical awareness, and ensuring equitable participation in an AI-driven society. To help them achieve AI literacy, this introductory-level course teaches students how to ethically and effectively use Generative AI (GAI) by exploring how GAI works, how to use it properly, and how to critically evaluate its output. Students will understand AI model functionality, distinguish GAI from traditional AI, examine issues of originality, authorship, intellectual property, copyright, plagiarism, fair use, accuracy, bias, environmental impacts, and privacy - all while developing meta-awareness about how AI simulates certain aspects of human creativity and cognition The course's placement in Barnard's English Department reflects the recognition that AI's development requires interdisciplinary perspectives beyond STEM, as AI research increasingly intersects with humanities and social sciences to address ethical, social, and cultural implications. Through ethics-focused assignments and writing projects culminating in a final research investigation in students' chosen fields, this course empowers students to resist pure AI reliance and actively control these technologies rather than remaining passive observers of AI's expanding influence in academia and society.

Spring 2026: Fiction and Personal Narrative: Crafting the Narrative "I"

In this workshop, we will practice taking creative risks, writing fiction and nonfiction. We will examine four key craft areas: voice, characterization, imagery, and arrangement, both in contemporary published writing and in the writing of the people in this class. In small and large group workshops, we will consider each writer’s work with care and attention to the writer’s vision. By discussing each work-in-progress on its own terms, we will help our fellow writers deepen the meaning and impact of their work. Through risk-taking, and building a creative community, we will also grow and deepen our personal relationships to craft. Model readings will be contemporary short stories or personal essays, mostly written in the first person, including work by Kali Fajardo-Anstine, Tony Tulathimutte, K-Ming Chang, Cleyvis Natera, Melissa Febos, Ling Ma, and Deesha Philyaw.

The most exciting, and the most terrifying, aspect of writing fiction is that there are no rules that cannot, under certain conditions, be broken. Good fiction makes and lives by its own rules. In this course, we will discuss common tenets of fiction writing—regarding character, plot, point-of-view, and more—and also examine cases in which writers break rules for the better. This course involves attentive reading of stories by various authors, discussions of craft, in-class writing, and workshops of student fiction. Readings may include Shirley Hazzard, Elias Khoury, James Wood, Elena Ferrante, Federico Garcia Lorca, and Sylvia Townsend Warner, among others.

Spring 2026:

Section 1, taught by Angel Nafis: Poetry Belongs With Us As legend Lucille Clifton said, “poetry began when somebody walked out of a cave and looked up at the sky with wonder and said, “Ahhh.” That was the first poem.” In this class we will be demystifying the fundamentals of writing poetry by sharpening our most natural sonic and narrative instincts. We will use these instincts to guide our insights as we explore and practice specific craft elements and structural gestures—from the Ode, Elegy, and Sonnet, to Ekphrasis and Erasure. We’ll study the work of contemporary luminaries like Gwendolyn Brooks, Kaveh Akbar, Sharon Olds, Jenny Xie, June Jordan, Ocean Vuong, and more; using their example to inspire us on how best to understand and command the poetic line. Class time will include weekly writing prompts and share-outs. Come prepared to take risks and foster curiosity.

 

Section 2, taught by Miranda Field: This class approaches poetry as a practice energized as much by playful provocation as by engagement with urgent issues of the day. In-class writing and weekly prompts designed to provoke creative ingenuity will keep you writing, ensuring everyone has new poems to workshop regularly. A list of quotes headed “What is This Thing Called Poetry?” starts the class off with a discussion intended to open our minds and challenge pre-conceived notions on the topic. This will be followed by other, more focused questions and propositions, providing discussion topics for each class: How do artifice and raw reality intertwine in a poem’s making? In what ways can poems deepen our understanding of ourselves, each other, and the world we share? How do we, as poets, unlock the full potential of our chosen medium, language? What do we mean by “voice” in a poem, and when and how does “voice” emerge? Required readings are central to our work together, and specified titles and volumes must be acquired by the third week of the semester. Supplemental material will be provided as handouts and distributed in class.

Often a playwright is surprised into their strongest work. The practices of experimentation and analysis, curiosity and audacity lead to new possibilities. Students will read and respond to plays, identifying elements and strategies, and each week bring in fragments and scenes written in response to weekly prompts. By the middle of the semester, students will choose the piece that feels the most viable and develop it into what in most cases will be a thirty page play. NOTE: Playwriting I (ENGL BC3113) is NOT a prerequisite, and students need not have written a play before.

Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

Writing sample required to apply. Instructions and the application form can be found here: https://english.barnard.edu/english/creative-writing-courses. 

Section 1 (taught by Sarah Wang in Spring 2026) Narrative Strategies: This course will explore the different ways that stories can be told. How a story is written is as important as what a story is about. Is there a turn at the end that changes everything you thought you knew? Is the narrator speaking from inside experience, reportage from the front lines of another world? How can the epistolary form be utilized to effect? Students will workshop their own stories, participate in four in-class generative writing sessions, and read weekly short stories demonstrating various strategies for style, voice, setting, dialogue, form, and point of view. Particular focus will be placed on writing from the margins and writing as an act of bearing witness.

Section 2 (taught by Gina Apostol in Spring 2026): This course will focus particularly on crafting the literary technique of point of view in fiction. Students will craft work with this question in mind: in what ways are art and ethics combined in the crafting of point of view? Students will practice writing from different narration modes: third person limited and omniscient, free indirect discourse, first person, and so on. They will consider the ethics of point of view by reading short stories, among them stories from Borges’s Labyrinths, John Keene’s Counternarratives, and Angela Carter’s Saints and Strangers. Some theoretical matters will include: postcoloniality in narration; identity in narration; ‘queering’ history; and critical race thought. Students will write three different pieces with the crafting of point of view in mind. Students will workshop each other’s pieces as well as discuss the texts in relation to their practice of the art of fiction.

What drives the music of a poem? How does one create rhythm and song? In what ways do chunks of language sort and arrange the perception of our readers? The purpose of this advanced poetry workshop is to closely study syntax, or in the words of Ellen Bryant Voigt, “the order of the words in each human utterance.” To further build upon our technical foundation as writers, we will also engage in other elements of craft, such as deep imagery, grammatical moods, tone, and poetic closure. We will be reading a variety of poets, including Etel Adnan, Rita Dove, Brigit Pegeen Kelly, John Murrillo, Choi Seungja, and Yuki Tanaka. Be prepared to generate new material independently for peer workshops where you will gain valuable feedback and constructive criticism. 

Apart from challenging your poetics on a technical level, I expect you to come to class with a strong desire to create meaning out of your daily lives, your personal or collective histories, and the futures that you are actively imagining. Your openness and willingness to grow as a human, poet, and critical thinker are fundamental to fostering a kind and supportive community in the classroom. Not only will you be writing poems, you will also learn to translate your soul’s language and help others do the same.

Spring 2026: Drawing Cartoons and Comics

In this class, New Yorker cartoonist and graphic novelist Liana Finck will teach you the basics of making single-panel cartoons, writing and drawing comics, and generally expressing yourself in a mixture of words and pictures. You will learn to diagram your problems, craft jokes, and tell stories visually. You’ll get an overview of useful materials, programs and machines, and how to use all these things with a light enough touch that you can still focus on your art. You will get comfortable with processes for generating ideas and editing your work. We will read some graphic novels, look at lots of cartoons, and dip a toe into the history of colloquial visual storytelling. You will finish the semester with a large body of small-scale work, one serious longer piece, and a better understanding of your voice and what you have to say. My hope is that you’ll leave the class confident in your ability to work visually, and with a regular practice if you want one.

Prerequisites: Enrollment limited to Barnard English majors. In the Enlightenment colloquium we will look at English and European imaginative and intellectual life during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. During this period, writers tried in new ways to reconcile the tensions between reason and religion. Categories of thought that underlie our world today were taking shape: secularity, progress, the public and the private, individual rights, religious tolerance. Writers articulated principles of equality in an era of slavery. Literary forms like the novel, which emerges into prominence during this period, express in irreducibly complex ways these and other changes. In this intensive course, we will study from multiple angles a variety of authors that may include Hobbes, Dryden, Locke, Spinoza, Lafayette, Defoe, Swift, Pope, Richardson, Voltaire, Fielding, Johnson, Diderot, Sterne, and Wollstonecraft, among others.

The seventeenth century was a century of revolution, giving birth to modern ways of thinking, and calling into question many of the old ways. In the early years, many were affected by melancholy, some believing the world was approaching the endtimes. England experienced plagues, particularly in London, and other catastrophes. So we might find some affinity with our own current situation, facing new challenges, our world turned upside down, which is what many people felt during that time. Out of all of this turmoil, however, came great literature including lyric poems by John Donne and others exploring love and desire, doubt and faith, sex and God. Donne also wrote a series of Devotions grappling with mortality over a course of 23 days when he was suffering from typhus or relapsing fever and almost died. Others turned to find solace in the natural world and friendship (Amelia Lanyer, Katherine Philips, Henry Vaughan). Robert Burton wrote a book on melancholy, which he kept adding to.  Francis Bacon thought a revolution in science could redeem the world. Thomas Browne, a physician as well as writer, tackled the problem of intolerance and religious conflict. Thomas Hobbes thought only a firm (authoritarian?) government could reestablish peace and security, while Gerard Winstanley (a “Leveller”) thought that owning land (and money) was the source of all war and misery. Transgressive women had their own ideas. The Quaker leader Margaret Fell defended women's right to preach. We will read selections from these and other writers, understanding them in their historical context and with a sense of their current resonance.The seventeenth century was a century of revolution, giving birth to modern ways of thinking, and calling into question many of the old ways.

VICTORIAN SCIENCE&SCIFI
ENGL3215BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

Although Victorian fiction is best known today for its realist commitment to representing the world “as it really is,” especially in genres such as the courtship novel and the Bildungsroman, Victorian novelists also wrote during an age of enthusiastic scientific inquiry that questioned and revised the very fabric of the reality that realist genres purported to represent. This course will accordingly explore the more adventurous and speculative fiction of the Victorian period that was most closely attuned to these new ways of representing and thinking about reality. How did new scientific developments such as evolutionary theory in biology, and the atomic theory in physics, reshape how writers viewed the relationships between human and animal, self and other, space and time, body and mind? How did departing from traditional realist modes enable Victorian science fiction writers to explore the ethical, social, and political implications of scientific theories in ways that scientific prose may not have envisioned? In this course we will read major works of Victorian fiction, by such authors as Mary Shelley, H.G. Wells, H. Rider Haggard, Robert Louis Stevenson, and others, alongside selections of scientific prose in such fields of Victorian science as biology, physics, mathematics, anthropology, and psychology. Throughout the course, we will understand “science” to include both major developments in the history of science, such as the emergence of evolutionary thought, as well as more eccentric Victorian areas of inquiry, such as phrenology, mesmerism, telepathy, and degeneration. The first three units into which the course is divided each explore a major field of Victorian science alongside a major conceptual category that it challenged and altered: biology and the nature of the human; psychology and the constitution of the self; the physical sciences and the nature of space and time. In each unit, we will investigate how writers’ engagements with these conceptual questions led them to experiment with literary categories such as character, narration, and plot. The course will close with a unit on texts that more broadly address Victorian conceptions of progress, technology, and development. In addition to these specific thematic and formal questions, we will think broadly about how the Victorians understood the value of science and technology in relation to the arts and to literature, and ask what their answers to these questions can offer us as we navigate similar questions today. What does scientific thinking offer to literature, and what kinds of questions can literature answer that scientific prose cannot? Do technological and scientific progress open up utopian vistas for humanity’s future, or are they more likely to lead to dystopian nightmares? Throughout the course, we will explore the resources that the literary imagination offers for thinking through the social consequences of scientific theories.

In this class we will discuss the narrative of the "American" story, and how stories of immigrants and minority identities redefine and complicate it. The goal of the class is to investigate how writers frame a sense of identity in relation to the "American ideal". We will explore this theme through three creative non-fiction pieces each focusing on a different perspective of place, person, and personal experience. What are your stories, and what makes them "American"?

1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

An interdisciplinary course focused on environmental humanities and based in the English department, “Changing Climate, Changing World” will examine the representation of nature across time and its implications for global warming and biodiversity from multiple perspectives, emphasizing issues of climate change and environmental justice. The course will provide a conceptual framework for reading and critiquing the representation of nature in the context of historical, economic, social, cultural, scientific and political change.


The course design asks students to address climate change in the context of the industrial revolution before discussing environmental issues in a pre-industrial and finally a post-industrial context. We will begin in media res by addressing issues of industrialization and colonialism in the mid-18th and 19th century before considering indigenous, medieval, and renaissance representations of nature. In the second half of the course, we return to examine contemporary issues from the early 20th century to the present.


The course will meet twice weekly in Spring 2025. One of these meetings will include a lecture with a guest faculty member from Barnard and Columbia, or occasionally with other experts, artists, and activists from New York and beyond, followed by questions from the audience on the lecture. The second meeting will emphasize student discussion of the lecture and associated readings, with the purpose of integrating each lecture into the total course framework. Since all the participating faculty are teaching full time, we will aim to schedule lectures in the late afternoon or evening to minimize conflicts. We would also like to open some of the lectures to the public, either virtually or in person, so that their impact could be felt beyond the class itself.

Cannibals! Orphans! Strikes! Vampires! This course asks how do horror stories employ suspense and disgust to unsettle political, social, and ethical complacency in the hearts and minds of readers and audiences? We will consider the pan-media global adaptations, translations, reiterations, and afterlives of several powerful horror stories—maritime, domestic, industrial, and supernatural-- as they serially repeat across national borders, languages, historical periods, and delivery platforms, from novels, plays, and film to an underwater sculpture, photographs, paintings, advertisements, a graphic novel, and other aesthetic forms. We will read each adaptation in synchronic dialogue with its companions, in diachronic perspective, and through relevant theoretical lenses, comparing the priorities of aesthetic form in the context of the national, cultural, and the historical contingencies of class and race difference. Texts may include the Raft of the Medusa, Jane Eyre, Mary Barton, Germinal, Dracula and the Dybbuk. Familiarity with French, Yiddish, Russian, Wolof (Atlantique), Korean (Parasite) and Persian (A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night) welcome but not required. All majors welcome!

(To count this course for the English major, all writing must focus on works originally published in English.)

DESIRE AND METAMORPHOSIS
ENGL3418BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

Change is fundamental to our experience as human beings, and the experience of change lies at the heart of most great stories. Sometimes this is a transition that the heroine has desired; other times, alteration and transformation arise from sources mysterious and unknown, or as a result of the journey the story has brought them. This course examines the element of change in a wide range of literature, from Ovid to Maggie Nelson, from Shakespeare to Roxane Gay—but it also provides an opportunity for students to consider the ways in which they, too have been changed—by joy, by trauma, by time. In addition to writing critically about the works we will read together, students will also write a personal essay about their experience of metamorphosis; this essay will be examined in a modified workshop format. At semester’s end, students will re-write and change that same essay, in hopes of seeing how revision on the page might provide a model for understanding the metamorphoses we experience as human beings on this earth. Authors will likely include Ovid, Kafka, Robert Louis Stevenson, Borges, Shaun Tan, Roxane Gay, George Saunders, Arthur C. Clarke, Shakespeare, and Maggie Nelson. There will be a final exam and a critical paper, as well as the personal essay, in two drafts.

GLOBAL LITERATURES IN ENGLISH
ENGL3521BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

The title of this course suggests that there are literatures across the “globe” written in English, and that we will study them. But this statement rests on a series of assumptions: the a priori existence of a globe with latitudes, longitudes, and borders; a singular category of “literature” produced in different geographical locations across the globe; and finally, that these literatures are written in English. During the course of the semester, we will investigate and (occasionally overturn) all three of these assumptions. 

In order to do so, we will read across different literary genres (short stories and novels, plays, poetry, and essays), while also reading texts that move between these genres or defy them altogether. We will read texts that were originally written in English, as well as texts that have been translated into English, and we will learn and discuss the term “global anglophone” along with the ways in which this term has been challenged. During our collective readings and discussions, we will map the locations that arise in each text and the locations out of which these texts arise. We will study the relationship between literature, translation, and mapping, and we will learn and discuss the concept of planetary thinking and writing as an alternative to border and global thinking.

THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN JOURNALISM OF CONSCIENCE FROM FREDERICK DOUGLASS TO THE PRESENT
ENGL3609BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

From Frederick Douglass’s The North Star, which insisted that journalism could be a tool for liberation and collective conscience, to today’s digital-first platforms, American journalism has always been a site of struggle over truth, power, and representation. This course explores the power of journalism to shape public conscience — from the days when print was the Twitter of its time to the rise of radio, television, and digital media. At its core, this seminar centers the voices of journalists of conscience — those who speak truth to power, challenge dominant narratives, and reflect the full spectrum of human experience. We will approach journalism through a lens that foregrounds the perspectives of people of color, recognizing how mainstream media has historically erased, distorted, or marginalized their voices while also highlighting the powerful traditions of resistance and self-representation in journalism.

To foster meaningful connection and collaboration, students will be split into groups for the semester. These groups will meet in breakout rooms during each class session to workshop ideas, respond to prompts, and sometimes collaborate on short journalistic pieces. The goal is to make a large seminar feel intimate and to encourage peer-to-peer dialogue throughout the course.


Through weekly readings, in-class discussions, site visits, guest speakers, and multimedia projects, students will examine how journalism has both reflected and resisted dominant narratives across history. Students will also create original work that embodies conscience-based journalism.

DEPRESSION
ENGL3644BC
1 section

Depression has existed for all time.  But our explanations of it has shifted, from sin, to an imbalance of the humours, and a poetic inspiration; from the eighteenth-century mechanistic understanding of the self, to the Freudian family romance that generates trauma, and to our current neuro-genetic understanding of the mind as a machine that can achieve happiness with pharmaceutical intervention.    We will follow these permutations, even as we read novels, poems, plays, and view film (and art) for their diagnostic awareness of mental suffering.   And we will also ask the question: what if depression comes not from within but without, the intelligent response of aware minds to a world that has become undone.

GENDER, SEXUALITY AND THE AMERICAN STAGE: PERFORMING THE BODY POLITIC
ENGL3750BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

This seminar investigates how American theatre/performance, as read through the lens of gender and sexuality, operates as a cultural force.  Simply put, the U.S. is obsessed with sex; theatre/performance has proven a fertile medium for America’s expression of this obsession. Exploring texts from the seventeenth through the twenty-first centuries, we will consider how performance intersects with the nation state’s desire to regulate how we “practice” gender both publicly and behind closed doors and how that intersects, overlaps and influences the politics of American Identity. How is performance, which always includes gendered/raced/classed/sexualized bodies, situated in relationship to ideas of a national body politic?  How does the American nation state hinge on how gender and sexuality are performed both on-stage and off?

LITERATURE ON DRUGS

Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

Whether as sources of artistic creativity, symbols of moral decay, avenues of escape, or
foundations for alternative forms of sociality, drugs are an inexhaustible source of inspiration
for all manner of storytellers. Why is that? This course surveys the narrative history of
“literature on drugs” from three angles: first, we examine poetry and fiction composed under
the influence of mind-altering intoxicants; second, we study literature about drug-induced
experiences and the counter-cultures they have fueled; and we ask why literary criticism is
essential to articulate the danger and allure of drugs, past, present, and future. We will read
from literary psychonauts including William Blake, William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick, Allen
Ginsberg, Aldous Huxley, Anaïs Nin, and Hunter S. Thompson; historians of the highly weird like
Michel Foucault and Erik Davis; and an array of primary sources on the legal, therapeutic, and
psychological complexities of drug use, such as Billy Holiday, Sigmund Freud, William James,
and Margaret Mead. We also will consider the cinematic history of literature on drugs with
films like Altered States, Trainspotting, and Apocalypse Now. The course incorporates hands-on
archival work and includes a visit to Columbia’s Rare Book and Manuscript Library.

OUT OF PLACE
ENGL3865BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

Literature has always attracted the outsider, and literature itself seems to demand from its writers to momentarily step out of the fray in order to hope to observe it. The modern age has offered different examples of this. When Bernard Levin described V.S. Naipaul as an ‘inquiline’ author — meaning, a guest or a lodger, an animal that lives in another's nest — Naipaul responded:

‘When I see the sun set here at Stonehenge, there is a way that it is somebody else’s sun, somebody else’s landscape, it has somebody’s else's history connected with it. I can't avoid that: that's the way I think.’

When Virginia Woolf received news of the death of Joseph Conrad, she sat down and penned an admiring obituary that opens with what might be read as a presumptuously arrogant statement:

‘Suddenly, without giving us time to arrange our thoughts or prepare our phrases, our guest has left us; and his withdrawal without farewell or ceremony is in keeping with his mysterious arrival, long years ago, to take up his lodging in this country.’

Despite Woolf’s English snobbishness, her words reveal something true about Conrad’s situation, and about the place of many other writers who were, for one reason or another, obliged to operate in foreign lands, inside other languages or states of being, authors such as V.S. Naipaul, Ovid, Robert Louis Stevenson, Joseph Conrad, Jean Rhys, Waguih Ghali and David Malouf.

Through the close analysis of a narrow selection of works, this class will chart the ways in which such works reveal the nature and imaginative location of the artist out of place. We will be interested in the question of to what extent is writing a process of mapping an intellectual, aesthetic, psychic or geographical territory. We will be motivated by close reading, interpretation, and the adventure of comparing different portraits of being an outsider-insider.

We may refer to fragments by travellers and explorers such as Leo Africanus, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, Bartolomé de las Casas, and Ibn Battuta, or look at the work of artists who crossed boundaries, such as the 15th century Venetian painter Gentile Bellini and the impact of his visit to Mehmed II’s court in 1479, or the influence of the Arabesque on the music of Claude Debussy.

We will explore what it is about literature and, in particular, the novel that has made it so well-suited for portraits of individuals existing out of place.

SENIOR PROJECT IN CREATIVE WRITING
ENGL3992BC
1 section

Enrollment limited to Barnard senior English majors with a concentration in creative writing.

This creative writing workshop represents an opportunity for creative writing concentrators to focus on one large project that will serve as a capstone senior project. As in a typical writing workshop, much of the focus will be on sharing and critiquing student work. Unlike other workshops, in this class students will focus on building out a longer project—such as a more ambitious full-length story for fiction and creative nonfiction writers and a chapbook for poets. This means students will discuss work by writers who may not share their own genre. We will focus on generating new work, developing your writing process, and creating new possibilities and momentum for your piece, as well as trying to create a sense of community among the concentrators. We will also conduct in-class writing exercises in response to short reading assignments and class lectures. Students should be aware of two important notes: (1) This class is limited to senior English majors who have already been approved to be creative writing concentrators; and (2) this course fulfills the requirement for concentrators to finish a senior project, but not the academic senior seminar requirement. This class is about your own writing and that of your classmates. This class will be what you make of it!

Jews in the Christian Imagination
ENRE3145BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

Since the beginning of the movement that would become Christianity, Jews have occupied a unique – and uniquely fraught – position in the Christian imagination. Why did so few of the very Jews to whom Jesus preached accept him as their messiah? Why, as the Church grew in wealth and influence, did Jews continue to live in Christian communities, and what was their proper place in Christian society? In our course, we will read early and medieval Christian narratives about Jews that are, in many ways, an attempt to answer these questions – dark imaginative visions of Jews as child-killers, cannibals, and devil worshippers. We will use narrative, psychological, and literary theory as tools to analyze these tales and to make sense of their complicated and continuing legacy.

Technologies of Modern Drama
ENTA4725GU
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

This seminar will consider theatre intermedially, taking up its use of dramatic writing as one, only one, of its determining technologies. In the first half of the semester we will use a series of philosophical questions—tools vs. technologies, techne vs. medium—to consider several dimensions of modern theatricality as technologies: of gender and genre, of space and place, of the body and its performance. After spring break, we will use the terms generated to consider a series of topics specifically inflected by the design and practice of modern theatricality. Students will each write one longer essay, and will have the opportunity to receive feedback on a draft, if desired.

HAMLET
ENTH3100UN
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

In this course, we will spend a semester reading, thinking about, seeing, and writing about one play, Shakespeare’s Hamlet. We will begin by reading Hamlet slowly, using various critical perspectives to attend to some of the historical and contemporary problematics of the play. In addition to glancing at sources (Saxo Grammaticus’ narrative of Amleth’s revenge in Historia Danica) and contemporaries (Thomas Kyd, The Spanish Tragedy), we’ll consider the relationship between the two media of Hamlet’s production, the book and the stage, taking the opportunity to consider what the three texts of Hamlets—the 1603 quarto, the 1604 quarto, and the folio version—have to say to us about our preconceptions of theatre and print. Then we will turn to two problems. The first is Hamlet as a conceptual challenge, focusing on Hamlet in modernism, notably as framed by Mallarmé, Eliot, Freud, and Joyce; as part of this consideration  we’ll take up some modern dramatic encounters with Hamlet, notably Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dea (1966), Heiner Müller’s Hamletmachine (1977) and Magda Romanska’s Opheliamachine (2013), Samuel Beckett’s Endgame (1957). We will conclude the semester by thinking about mediated performance, beginning with Laurence Olivier’s controversial (and award-winning) 1948 film, and tracing through Michael Almereyda’s 2000 media allegory,  concluding with two productions that move Hamlet into the sphere of digital performance, The Wooster Group Hamlet (2007) and Annie Dorsen’s A Piece of Work (2013).

Shakespeare's plays as theatrical events. Differing performance spaces, acting traditions, directorial frames, theatre practices, performance theories, critical studies, cultural codes, and historical conventions promote differing modes of engagement with drama in performance.

Modern American Drama and Performance in an era of cultural contestation.  What is united about the United States? How are the important claims of cultural difference related to the intercultural claims of shared community?  Is there a place for historical continuity in the modernist pursuit of change?  How have these issues been addressed in the emergence and development of modern drama and performance in America?  Questions such as these will be addressed in the context of theatrical exploration, performance history, and social change.  Canonical and experimental playwrights include Rachel Crothers, Susan Glaspell, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Eugene O’Neill, Clifford Odets, Thornton Wilder, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Lorraine Hansberry, Edward Albee, Suzan-Lori Parks, Sarah Ruhl, and Dominique Morisseau.

SCREENWRITING FUNDAMENTALS
FILM3119BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

Prerequisites: FILM BC3201 or equivalent. Enrollment limited to 12 students. Priority is given to Film Studies majors/concentrations in order of class seniority. Corequisites: (Since this is a Film course, it does not count as a writing course for English majors with a Writing Concentration.)

This course is ideal for writers of their FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD screenplays. The first several weeks will focus on STORY: What it is, what it isn’t, how to recognize the difference. How to find your own individual stories that nobody else in the universe can tell.

From there we will make the transition to the highly individualized techniques, the strengths and limitations, the dynamics of telling a SCREEN STORY; what to leave in, what to leave out. As Michelangelo puts it—starting with a block of marble and chipping away everything that isn’t David.  Through studies of existing screenplays and films in coordination with and hands-on writing exercises which we will share in class, we will develop our skills in all aspects of screenwriting; building fascinating characters, dialogue, story construction (The BIG PICTURE) and scene construction (The Small Picture)

Perfection is not the goal; but rather it is to be able to say truly at the end of each day’s writing, “I did the best I could with what I had at the time. (Phillip Roth quoting heavyweight champion Joe Louis)

[Prerequisite: FILM BC3201 or equivalent. Please note that since this is a Film Studies course, it does not count as a creative writing course for English majors with a creative writing concentration.] This course will focus on the primary pillar of television production: the teleplay. Through a number of creative exercises, students will learn the intricacies of the unique screenwriting formats that are the half-hour and hour-long teleplays. Together we will cover the differences between an episode arc and a seasonal one, the requirements of A/B/C story plotting, and how to write an effective show bible. We will survey the existing pantheon of great television writing in order to help students narrow in on their individual sensibilities. By the end of the course, students will have a written original pilot and a mini series bible.

DIGITAL PRODUCTION
FILM3278BC
1 section
Satisfies "Thinking Technologically and Digitally" Requirement (Barnard)

Prerequisites: both FILM BC3201 (or equivalent) and FILM BC3200 (or equivalent). Digital Production offers visual storytellers an incredible medium to connect and build an audience. It is an inexpensive, accessible platform to launch micro-budget concepts. Developing the storytellers voice  inexpensively is critical to the evolution of any student, no matter their starting point. The Digital Series course is intended to take students from story ideation through creation of an independent digital series. Emanating from a writers room setting, all steps of the process will be explored and supported by in-class discussion, examples and workshops. This hands-on class revolves around the TV series production model: breaking story, writing pages, preproduction planning, filming and post-production review. We will emphasize the writers voice, construction of series storytelling, and establishing realistic scopes of production.

QUEER VISIONS IN CONTEMPORARY FILM
FILM3331BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

In this class, we will focus on recurring themes and questions of contemporary queer cinema by engaging with a number of film genres and forms, and explore how filmmakers create queer visions of the world through their cinematic practices. We will also consider how these queer films are informed by various local, national, cultural and political contexts. Through a comparative, transnational and intersectional approach that takes into consideration the particularities of each filmmaker’s context, we will aim to answer the following questions: How do various cultural, national, linguistic, religious contexts affect the way queer identities are defined and depicted visually? How do these filmmakers create queer narratives that contest, complicate or reify dominant narratives of gender and sexuality? How do they play around with cinematic and genre conventions?

Films, directors and genres studied are subject to change but will likely include directors such as Celine Sciamma, Cheryl Dunye, Pedro Almodovar, Todd Haynes, among others; and various genres such as drama, romance, thriller, mockumentary, thriller and experimental film.

Traditional film history has consigned a multitude of cinema practices to an inferior position. By accepting Hollywood’s narrative model as central, film scholars have often relegated non-male, non-white, non-Western films to a secondary role. Often described as “marginal” or “peripheral” cinemas, the outcomes of these film practices have been systematically excluded from the canon. Yet… are these motion pictures really “secondary”? In relation to what? And according to whom? This course looks at major films by women filmmakers of the 20th Century within a tradition of political cinema that 1) directly confronts the hegemonic masculinity of the Hollywood film industry, and 2) relocates the so-called “alternative women’s cinema” at the core of film history. Unlike conventional feminist film courses, which tend to be contemporary and anglocentric, this class adopts a historical and worldwide perspective; rather than focusing on female directors working in America today, we trace the origins of women’s cinema in different cities of the world (Berlin, Paris, New York) during the silent period, and, from there, we move forward to study major works by international radical directors such as Lorenza Mazzetti, Agnès Varda, Forough Farrokhzad, Věra Chytilová, Chantal Akerman, Lina Wertmüller, Barbara Loden, Julie Dash, and Mira Nair. We analyse how these filmmakers have explored womanhood not only as a source of oppresion (critique of patriarchal phallocentrism, challenge to heteronormativity, etc) but, most importantly, as a source of empowerment (defense of matriarchy, equal rights, lesbian love, inter- and transexuality...). Required readings include seminal texts of feminist film theory by Claire Johnston, Laura Mulvey, Ann Kaplan, bell hooks, and Judith Butler. Among the films screened in the classroom are silent movies –Suspense (Lois Weber, 1913), The Seashell and the Clergyman (Germaine Dulac, 1928)—, early independent and experimental cinema –Girls in Uniform (Leontine Sagan, 1931), Ritual in Transfigured Time (Maya Deren, 1946)—, “new wave” films of the 1950s and 1960s –Cléo from 5 to 7 (Varda, 1962), Daisies (Chytilová, 1966)–, auteur cinema of the 1970s –Seven Beauties (Wertmüller, 1974), Jeanne Dielman (Akerman, 1975)–, and documentary films – Ellis Island (Monk, 1982) and Paris Is Burning (Livingston, 1990).

This seminar examines the history of the French language, both in France and in the many areas of the world in which French is a primary language. In the first part of the semester we engage in a chronological study of how the language emerged from a fusion of late medieval Latin with Germanic dialects to become a strong national institution. The development of the language is contextualized by consideration of the social and political history of France. We also devote two weeks of discussion to the situation of the French language today, with topics such as linguistic legislation, regional languages and dialects today, and gender inclusivity. This diachronic approach is carried over into the second part of the semester in which we concentrate on French in several regions outside of France including the Caribbean, North Africa, Central Africa, and North America.  Here we examine how the language was first introduced, what it represented at different moments in history, the relation of French to other languages, and the situation of French in the region today. Work for the course includes a digital project (digital timeline and map, and website) to document visually the presence of French in the world, across history and in the 21st century.

FIRST-YEAR SEMINAR AT BARNARD
FYSB1001BC
23 sections

First-Year Seminars initiate students into the academic life of the College by offering intellectually engaging experiences in which students and faculty from a wide range of home departments work through challenging material, often across disciplinary lines. Each one-semester seminar is designed to develop essential skills for college work, such as the ability to read critically and analytically, to speak clearly and effectively, and to write logically and persuasively.

First-Year Seminars vary in content and format, and fall into two categories: Special Topics and Reacting to the Past.   Descriptions are available in Vergil.

In this course we will engage with various forms of artistic production (literary, cinematic, pictorial, musical) that have been banned or censored by religious authority, governmental institutions, or by public opinion. While discussing these primary texts we will investigate who gets to censor art, to what ends, and according to which criteria. Who is protected from tasteless, subversive, or obscene art? How do these categories change with time, and from culture to culture?

During your first year of college, this seminar asks you to consider notions of home—being away from home, what makes a home, home's connection to identity, belonging, origins, and more—through film and literature from around the world and across time. Students will explore the visual as well as literary storytelling techniques and the moral questions that filmmakers and authors engage, reading critical texts to inform our discussions.

Can the violent fantasies of a fairytale shape romantic comedy? Can dance tell the same story as classical tragedy? What does Bollywood have to do with Renaissance England? Can ancient mythology animate American slave narrative? This class asks why do certain stories get told and retold in such a dazzling array of varieties? This course will explore the accretion of meaning that results when stories cross, historical, cultural, and generic borders.

This course is about witches…but what are witches about? Witches are about gender, sexuality, fear, and authority, among other things. From Mesopotamian goddess worship to the frenzied witch hunts of early modern Europe to the child-devouring crones of folk tales from cultures around the world, we’ll delve into what the witch reveals about deeply-held cultural beliefs, desires, and anxieties.

What is the “cosmic history” of the atoms that compose our bodies and the world around us? How do these elements come together to make us us during life’s fleeting journey? What becomes of our atoms after we die? In examining such questions, we will celebrate chemistry’s Periodic Table of the Elements as one of humanity’s great intellectual achievements and join with poets to sing elemental songs on scales minute and enormous, instantaneous and eternal.

How do we reflect on the intimacies of friendship, and what might be particular to such intimacies between women? What makes a friendship good or bad? What tensions or correspondences might we trace between friendship and adjacent categories of relationality—’frenemies,’ sisterhood, lovers? In this course, we will apply close analytical examinations of literary and cultural texts in order to theorize the various shapes friendship may take.

Why do we tell stories? Why do we feel a need to relate the things that happen to us? Why do writers and artists make things up? In this section of First-Year Seminar, we will explore these and other questions connected to the fundamental practice of storytelling. We will discuss short stories, novels, and memoirs that reflect on or call into question the narrator’s reasons for telling the story and essays by literary critics, psychologists, and scientists on the human impulse to narrate.

Poetry is a series of words found in books written by white men who died a half a century ago. Or is it? Poetry is archaic. Poetry is academic. Poetry is hard. Or in the words of Ntosake Shange, it’s “razzamatazz hocus pocus zippity-do-dah.” The magic of poetry is not in its mystery, but in its ability to connect with people, and to connect people with people, even across space and time. We will explore how it speaks to identity, history, race, gender, sexuality, tragedy, triumph, and trauma.

The modern city is a privileged site for considering the relationship between art, its publics and settings—as much as the source for the reinvention of “art” as a new ground to address and engage different kinds of audiences, far beyond the museum walls. This seminar will allow you to delve into the rich history of the evolving relationship between art and place, and the attendant battles for social justice and a more democratic, inclusive society, with an emphasis on our own city, New York.

Long before humans walked the Earth; volcanoes were a feature on our planet. With the power to create life, as well as to destroy it, volcanoes inspire awe and terror. This seminar, Hot Stuff, will explore the science behind volcanoes, their impact on the environment, and our enduring fascination with them. Why, how, and where do volcanoes erupt? How do they affect nature, climate, and society? These are some of the many questions that students will seek to answer throughout the semester.

Can the idea of an imaginary island think us out of the world we know? To what degree are all attempts at world-building doomed to repetition? Can Utopia be separated from its colonial roots? Beatriz Pastor Bodmer has defined utopia as “movement, transformation, incessant change” against the grain of history. We will read and rethink Utopia about and from the Americas. Authors include Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Edward Bellamy, Luisa Capetillo, and Octavia Butler.

The end of the world is a recurrent literary theme, religious fixation, philosophical conundrum, source of endless entertainment, and spring of existential anxiety. This first-year seminar investigates “the end” both as a question of ruins and remnants and as a site of new beginnings and possible futures. We examine fiction, drama, poetry, and film, as well as and studies in cultural anthropology, environmental humanities, radical ecologies, and psychoanalysis.

Remembering is always intertwined with forgetting, and engineering memory gives rise to the shape of history. The concept of cultural memory helps us navigate the blurred boundaries between subjective and objective, individual and communal, memory and history. This first-year seminar explores these tensions through topics such as the art of memory, memory theories, and cultural manifestations including amnesia, trauma, nostalgia, and the reinvention of plural histories.

In these seminars, students play complex historical role-playing games informed by classic texts. After an initial set-up phase, class sessions are run by students. These seminars are speaking- and writing-intensive, as students pursue their assigned roles objectives by convincing classmates of their views. For example, one game explores a pivotal moment following the defeat of Athens in the Peloponnesian War, when democrats sought to restore democracy while critics proposed alternatives.

How does culture create and codify beliefs and norms so that they appear natural and difficult to identify without close analysis? In this course, we will explore aspects of our society that are hidden in plain sight through the forces of ideology. We will study works that challenge us to look closely at the things we think we already know. In doing so, we will dive into pop cultural moments (such as brat summer and the like), identifying power formations which otherwise remain hidden.

Learning is shaped by the interaction between memory, attention, motivation, and sleep. This seminar explores these cognitive processes through an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from neuropsychology, evolution, education, and technology. Students will strengthen their metacognitive skills by engaging with these concepts and by connecting them to their own lived experiences through discussions, journaling, critical analysis of multimedia materials, and a group project.

Who or what are monsters? What role do these monsters play in our society and culture? And who determines the parameters of monstrosity? In this course, we will analyze questions such as these, in both a historical and contemporary context. We will look to a range of sources – literature, film, artwork, folklore, scientific treatises, bestiaries, ballads, modern pop culture, and the like – to understand what monsters and monstrosity can teach us about ourselves, our culture, and our communities.

Care is often understood through its asymmetry—an imbalance between the care receiver’s need and the caregiver’s sacrifice. This course complicates this understanding of care through readings in anthropology, political theory, and philosophy, engaging new debates about care systems in nonprofit social services, welfare provision, healthcare technologies, and humanitarian aid. Students examine the intimacies of care at home and map care bureaucracies at local and global scales.

Care is often understood through its asymmetry—an imbalance between the care receiver’s need and the caregiver’s sacrifice. This course complicates this understanding of care through readings in anthropology, political theory, and philosophy, engaging new debates about care systems in nonprofit social services, welfare provision, healthcare technologies, and humanitarian aid. Students examine the intimacies of care at home and map care bureaucracies at local and global scales.

Narnia. Middle-earth. Oz. Wakanda. Our stories are full of imagined worlds. Why? In this class, we will explore a wide variety of imagined worlds. We'll investigate how they’re built, how they cast their spell, and how they illuminate and challenge the world we live in. What do they reveal about our own flawed world? And how do these other worlds ultimately reimagine what is possible? In response to our investigations, students will embark on a semester-long world-building project of their own.

FIRST-YEAR SEMINAR WORKSHOP
FYSB1002BC
2 sections

First-Year Seminars initiate students into the academic life of the College by offering intellectually engaging experiences in which students and faculty from a wide range of home departments work through challenging material, often across disciplinary lines. Each one-semester seminar is designed to develop essential skills for college work, such as the ability to read critically and analytically, to speak clearly and effectively, and to write logically and persuasively.

First-Year Seminar Workshops — 4-credit versions of First-Year Seminars—are specially designed for students who believe they would benefit from extra support with their critical reading and academic writing skills. In addition to regular seminar meetings twice per week, students are also required to participate in six Friday “writing labs” over the course of the semester. 

First-Year Seminar Workshops vary in content.  Descriptions can be found in Vergil.

FIRST-YEAR WRITING AT BARNARD
FYWB1001BC
22 sections

First-Year Writing (FYW) courses invite students into the vibrant scholarly life of the college. Working in small, discussion-based seminar classes over the course of one semester, we read challenging literary texts and critical scholarship, helping students to develop fundamental skills in analysis and academic writing that allow them to take their place in vitally important scholarly conversations. Students may choose from a variety of special topics that focus on a particular literary tradition, theme, or phenomenon. Please see https://firstyear.barnard.edu/fyw/course-listings for full course descriptions.

ELEMENTARY GERMAN II
GERM1102UN
4 sections
Satisfies Language Requirement (Barnard)

Prerequisites: GERM UN1101 or the equivalent. If you have prior German outside of Columbia’s language sequence, the placement exam is required. German 1102 is the continuation of Elementary German I (1101). It is a four-skill language course taught in German, in which students continue to develop listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills in German and an understanding of German-speaking cultures. Emphasis is placed on acquiring the four language skills--listening, speaking, reading and writing--within a cultural context. Students expand their communication skills to include travel, storytelling, personal well- being, basic economics, recent historical events, and working with movie segments. Completion of daily assignments, which align with class content, and consistent work are necessary in order to achieve basic communicative proficiency.

Tempo - Bodies in Motion: Leisure, exercise and adventure in 19th c./20th literature
GERM3082BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies Language Requirement (Barnard)

 

This course introduces students of German on the advanced level of language acquisition to depictions of wayfarers in Romantic and modern literature. It includes more recent, 21st-century developments such as literary representations of extreme or physically challenging adventure sports. The selection of texts is geared toward exploring the human experience of leisurely or athletic experiences in urban or natural surroundings. The literary sources make us aware of how the experience of hiking, walking, swimming or climbing is inextricably tied to an understanding of the value of outdoor activities while acknowledging the strong impact of modern technology (maps, GPS, special gear or means of transportation) and recognizing changing attitudes toward strenuous or even risky movements in mountains, rivers, seas or deserts. First, a number of memorable Romantic songs and short poems will give us the opportunity to quickly identify central themes; as we move from poetry to prose, we will continuously adhere to the principle of simplicity and conciseness; this is why we will limit the scope of analysis by using excerpts from novels or longer stories. This way we can spend time on expanding your vocabulary; other features—such as grammar, central motifs, and stylistic features will be of equal importance. Our aim is to reduce the complexity of a text written in German to manageable level and develop our own lexicon for discussing the main topic of “bodies in motion.”

Making Vikings
HIST2099BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

Between the 700s and 1000s, pirates known as Vikings raided much of Europe. Some were linked to merchant groups reaching into Central Asia, while others joined diaspora communities that sailed across the Atlantic. They made their worlds in many ways—through texts, images, artifacts, and behaviors. In this class, students will accomplish the same, guided by the principle that making is best studied by doing. This will be accomplished through a series of creative assignments accompanied by written discussions drawing on scholarship and historical materials. The course will culminate in a written proposal for a museum exhibit allowing students to explore chosen narratives or thematic interests. Through this work, students will learn how Viking-Age peoples made their world and consider how we recreate and represent that world today

Gender and Sexuality in European History
HIST2195BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

This course examines the history of gender and sexuality in Europe, from the Renaissance to the present day. We will take a thematic approach, tracing the shifting operations, definitions, and understandings of both gender and sexuality within European culture and society. Topics include: Renaissance visual culture, the witchcraft trials, Enlightenment philosophy, European imperialism and colonialism, revolutions (both political and sexual), moral reform campaigns, the birth of sexology, queer and trans histories, sex work, and the politics of control. Central to this course is an examination of the ways gender and sexuality function at the intersections of class, race, nation, ethnicity, and religion, and how these intersections speak to dynamics of social, cultural, and political power. In our work throughout the semester, we will draw from a range of sources, including film, painting, photography, literature, and music. We will regularly engage with primary sources, which will allow students to learn the skills and techniques necessary for the work of historians. Throughout the course, students will examine how historians write, interpret, and construct histories of gender and sexuality, and question what place these histories have in our contemporary world.

Fascism in European History
HIST2375BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

What was Fascism? What kind of appeal did authoritarianism and dictatorship have in interwar Europe? How did the Fascist “New Order” challenge liberal democracies and why did it fail in World War II? What was the common denominator of Fascist movements across Europe, and in particular in Mussolini’s Italy, Salazar’s Portugal, Franco’s Spain, culminating in Nazi Germany?

This class examines the history of Fascism as an ideology, constellation of political movements, and authoritarian regimes that aimed at controlling the modernization of European societies in the interwar period. Thus, the course focuses in particular on the relationship between politics, science and society to investigate how Fascism envisioned the modernity of new technologies, new social norms, and new political norms. The class will also explore Fascism’s imperialist goals, such as the calls for national renewal, the engineering of a new race, and the creation of a new world order.

Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

This course is intended to offer a survey of the history of a complex and vast region through two centuries. In order to balance the specificity of particular histories and larger processes common to Latin America, units will often start with a general presentation of the main questions and will be followed by lectures devoted to specific countries, regions, or themes. We will look closely at the formation of class and ethnic identities, the struggle around state formation, and the links between Latin America and other regions of the world. We will stress the local dimension of these processes: the specific actors, institutions and experiences that shaped the diversity and commonalities of Latin American societies. The assignments, discussion sections, and lectures are intended to introduce students to the key conceptual problems and the most innovative historical research on the region and to encourage their own critical reading of Latin American history.

1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

Economic inequality characterizes virtually every human society, informing deep social dynamics. And yet scholars and lay people alike hold vastly differing opinions about the effects that inequality has on the social fabric, and the need to combat it. The question of how wealth and income are distributed among the members of a national community as well as among nations has acquired center stage in analyses about fundamental issues such as the causes of the progress and decline of societies and the dynamics of globalization. Inequality issues are at the heart of discussions about international economic relations, transnational phenomena such as migrations and the domestic economic platforms of political parties.

This course will provide students with the critical instruments with which to analyze the main interpretations of economic inequality from the eighteenth century to the present. We will read and discuss authors who have addressed the question of inequality and distribution: how did they frame the issue? What visions of society emerged from their analyses? We will see how the concept of inequality has changed historically, how different dimensions (e.g., national and international) have appeared and disappeared, and how visions of national, international and global inequality inform debates about the foundational elements of the social compact.

This seminar prepares students to engage with material sciences used in historical studies. Students will examine how ice cores, tree rings, isotopes, bone morphology, genetic materials, and chemical compositions have all been used as keys into the human past, appraising successes and failures. Assignments will offer temporal depth and geographic breadth, ranging from the micro to the global. This course contributes to curricula for the Columbia Center for Science and Society, emphasizing connectivity, migration, and the environment to support the Climate Humanities minor while examining to how material studies are used in broader support of the Science and Society minor. Students from the sciences will meanwhile have an opportunity to develop skills in navigating and communicating within humanistic understandings of rigor. This course will culminate in students selecting a site, collection, or method to evaluate how studies have measured against apparent possibilities for scientific research and historical interpretation in that field.

Science and Fascism
HIST3301BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

In 1942, the American sociologist Robert Merton described modern science as an intellectual enterprise that can produce truthful and factual knowledge only if inspired by democratic values. Yet such concept contrasted starkly with the reality of science in the interwar period and World War II, at the peak of the clash between liberal democracies and fascist dictatorships. What was the role of science in the global conflict between liberalism and the fascist ‘New Order’? What did science and technology look like under fascism?

This class examines the relationship between science and fascism in Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, Franco’s Spain, and Salazar’s Portugal. During the Great War (1914-1918), science and technology were enlisted as critical assets for the war effort and the international scientific community was shattered across national lines. The Great War proved the importance of the scientific organization of society and state-controlled scientific advancement. Fascism developed this lesson in the interwar period to pursue its nationalist and imperialist goal: the creation of a new world order.

Thus, the seminar explores the entanglement between science, technology and fascism by examining a wide range of disciplines, such as physics, medicine, eugenics, statistics, demography, agronomy, and engineering. Focusing in particular on fascism’s central themes of race and empire, the course examines the relationship between state power and scientific expertise, the persecution of Jewish scientists in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, and scientists’ critical competition in World War II ahead of the creation of the atomic bomb, which ushered in the new era of the Cold War.

In this seminar, we will read a selection of masterpieces in economics to explore how economic thought on capitalism has changed over time. Through weekly discussions, we will examine a number of must-read volumes that shape the field of economics and more broadly, the social sciences today. We will also develop a general understanding of the different epochs of economic thinking about the evolving capitalist system. We will analyze classics such as Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations, Karl Marx’s Capital, and John M. Keynes’ General Theory, as well as more recent classics that have deeply influenced social science thinking in the second half of the XX century. This seminar is intended both for students in history, the humanities and the social sciences who have an interest in understanding the evolution of the economics discipline in historical perspective, and for economics students who want to develop an historical understanding of their discipline.

This undergraduate seminar offers an introduction to the study of mass media and politics in Latin America from the early 19th to the early 21st century. Throughout the course, the students will get acquainted with some of the key concepts, problems, and methods through which historians and communication scholars have probed the relationship between mass media and political power in the region. We will define and understand media broadly, but we will focus largely on printed media and, to a lesser extent, radio, cinema, and television. We will discuss both breaks and continuities between different media technologies, journalistic cultures, and political regimes. Knowledge of Spanish is welcome, but not mandatory.

Above all, as social scientist Margaret Peil once said, Lagos: The city is the people. At last count, over 15 million people to be (in)exact which makes Lagos the second most densely populated city in Africa. How does a city like Lagos come into being? What are its origins?  What is its history in regional, continental, and global context?  How does it ‘work’ and what work does it do for our understandings of cities, urbanization, urbanism, colonialism, globalization, trans-nationalism, and the spatial factor in Africanist historical analyses?  This course examines the many Lagoses that have existed over time, in space, and in the imagination from the city’s origins to the 21st century.  This is a reading, writing, viewing, and listening intensive course.  We will be reading scholarly, policy-oriented, and popular sources on Lagos as well as screening films and audio recordings that feature Lagos in order to learn about the social, cultural, and intellectual history of this West African mega-city.

Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Locally - New York City" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Technologically and Digitally" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

B. R. Ambedkar is arguably one of Columbia University’s most illustrious alumni, and a democratic thinker and constitutional lawyer who had enormous impact in shaping India, the world’s largest democracy. As is well known, Ambedkar came to Columbia University in July 1913 to start a doctoral program in Political Science. He graduated in 1915 with a Masters degree, and got his doctorate from Columbia in 1927 after having studied with some of the great figures of interwar American thought including Edwin Seligman, James Shotwell, Harvey Robinson, and John Dewey.

 

This course follows the model of the Columbia University and Slavery course and draws extensively on the relevant holdings and resources of Columbia’s RBML, [Rare Books and Manuscript Library] Burke Library (Union Theological Seminar), and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture among others to explore a set of relatively understudied links between Ambedkar, Columbia University, and the intellectual history of the interwar period. Themes include: the development of the disciplines at Columbia University and their relationship to new paradigms of social scientific study; the role of historical comparison between caste and race in producing new models of scholarship and political solidarity; links between figures such as Ambedkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, W. E. B. Du Bois and others who were shaped by the distinctive public and political culture of New York City, and more.

This is a hybrid course which aims to create a finding aid for B. R. Ambedkar that traverses RBML private papers. Students will engage in a number of activities towards that purpose. They will attend multiple instructional sessions at the RBML to train students in using archives; they will make public presentations on their topics, which will be archived in video form; and stuents will produce digital essays on a variety of themes and topics related to the course. Students will work collaboratively in small groups and undertake focused archival research.  This seminar inaugurates an on-going, multiyear effort to grapple with globalizing the reach and relevance of B. R. Ambedkar and to share our findings with the Columbia community and beyond.  Working independently, students will define and pursue individual research projects.  Working together, the class will create digital visualizations of these projects.

One of the most hotly debated issues of today is the extent to which the state can legitimately dictate or impinge on one’s bodily autonomy. This is a long-running debate in the area of sexual and reproductive rights, but also is relevant to such current debates as the right to die / right to death with dignity; the right to use drugs for recreational or ritual purposes; engaging in hunger strikes as a protected form of freedom of expression; and the debate about whether the state can mandate vaccines. It is a debate that is highly gendered but also raises questions about how political power and socio-economic status influences how governments act on individuals and communities.

Seeking Sanctuary in New York City

Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Locally - New York City" Requirement (Barnard)
Sustainability Related

In a renewed age of anti-immigrant fervor, the last few years have seen attention focused on people seeking asylum – the process under international law by which people fleeing persecution can seek protection in a country not of their citizenship. New York has become a particular flashpoint with a large influx of asylum seekers, most of them from Latin America. Often, they have arrived on buses sent here by southern governors intending to make the border “problem” that of a so-called “sanctuary city.” How has New York responded? And how does this fit into the city’s long history of refuge? 

This course will offer students an introduction to the theory, ethics, and history of the idea of international protection. We will look specifically at how Latin American citizens have engaged with the US asylum system over time and how this engagement has changed the shape of US immigration laws. We will study the origins of the ideas of international protection, who is understood to qualify and why, how the system has changed over time, and what these developments mean for a broader understanding of human rights across borders. We will also take a critical look at asylum, examine ideas of deservingness and innocence and their intersection with categories of race, class and gender, and question what it means for certain people to be constructed as victims and others to be seen as not eligible – or worthy – of protection.

This is an engaged pedagogy course. The class will be organized around a close collaboration with a NY legal organization that has taken on the work of representing many asylum seekers in the city. Students will learn the complexities of US asylum law and will work collectively to use this knowledge, while developing their research skills, to put together reports to be used in active asylum cases.

Power, Politics, and Procedure in US Immigration Court
HRTS3935BC
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Locally - New York City" Requirement (Barnard)

Immigration court has been described as akin to trying death penalty cases in traffic court. With a backlog of over two million cases and counting, judges have impossibly full dockets, cases get continued at the last minute, and many people are left to their own devices to try to make sense of what their options might be to stay in the United States. A key part of this confusion is because immigration court – though the stakes of decisions are as high as can be – is civil, not criminal. Given this, individuals are not guaranteed the right to a court appointed attorney. New York City, however, has been on the forefront of trying to remedy at least this part of the equation, piloting a unique program to guarantee representation to New Yorkers facing removal proceedings. While having access to an attorney can make a meaningful difference, immigration judges still enjoy wide discretion in how they decide a given case.

The core idea of this course is that there is a real utility to observing immigration court, both for research and for contributing to social change.  This course will center around a practice of court watching in immigration court in order to develop a scholarly analysis of systems, institutions, and the functioning (or not) of the law. At the same time, this court watching practice will also involve the systematic collection of qualitative data that may be directly useful to immigration attorneys and their clients in their perpetual effort to hold immigration courts accountable and create as fair as possible of a playing field that upholds the basic principles of human rights. To that end, in this class we will study how to conduct courtroom observations, drawing from different methodological approaches and findings, study the idea, history, and critiques of immigration law from across disciplines, and conduct extensive, in depth, immigration court watching. We will partner with local legal services organizations in order to sharpen our sense of what kinds of data is useful for their specific legal interventions and to ensure that the data that we do collect and interpret can become part of a larger project to hold courts accountable.

This course will offer students a unique opportunity to see how rigorous social science research and analysis can have real impacts in the world beyond the classroom, and how those two realms, through collaboration, can mutually contribute to advancing social change. They will learn first-hand how the careful application of qualitative research can reveal and sometimes remedy real world situations of structural injustice.

This is an engaged pedagogy course. The class will be organized around a close collaboration with a local legal services provider that represents immigrants in court in New York City. Students will learn the complexities of US immigration law and will work collectively, with the local organization, to develop data that could be useful in broader efforts to reform the process by which immigration claims are adjudicated.

A BARNARD EDUCATION AT WORK
HUMA1111BC
1 section

Per its mission statement, “Barnard College aims to provide the highest-quality liberal arts
education to promising and high-achieving young women… They graduate prepared to lead
lives that are professionally satisfying and successful, personally fulfilling, and enriched by a love
of learning.” This course finds its roots in the connection posited here, between undergraduate
study and professional life. Students will be asked to revisit a foundational text they have
encountered in their major, and use it as a mode of exploration and reflection on an internship.
They will consider how the text’s themes and ideas can be reinterpreted and recontextualized in
the working world, and think about what practical, moral, political, aesthetic and personal
insights it affords. More broadly, students will be prompted to consider the relationship of the
liberal arts degree (which purports to prepare students for no particular career) to their chosen
career path. This course will further hone the critical thinking and writing skills that are
translatable to any profession, and enables a Barnard student to put into practice the
complexities they have learned in the classroom, by encouraging them to analyze the
professional world from different perspectives, and in the context of other ideas and traditions.
The text will be selected from a list provided by the student’s major department, and will be
subject to approval from the course instructor.
On a weekly basis, in this discussion-based class, the student shares their ideas about their text
and how it relates to their internship. They respond to and engage with their classmates. They
are required to spend about two hours with their text per week. They are also required to
create a presentation, to be shared with the full group. The group is also
responsible for providing feedback on the presentation. The presentation ultimately evolves
into a final paper that explores the line of inquiry from their text as it is
instantiated in their work experience. Students are graded on their discussion (40%),
presentation (25%), and final paper (35%).

Satisfies Language Requirement (Barnard)

Ciao! I am so thrilled that you have chosen to study Italian at Barnard. This class marks the beginning of your journey through the wonderful language, history, and culture of Italy. I am hopeful that our time together will be fruitful, informative, and fun.

This document outlines the course objectives, requirements and policies for Elementary Italian 2.  I have chosen to outline these policies in English so that they are as clear as possible, but Italian is the official language of the course, and classes will be conducted accordingly. Some English will be used at the beginning of the semester as we get to know each other, but it will be phased out over the course of our time together.

Introduction to Korean Society: Exploring Cultural Codes through Media and Literature
KORN2345BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

This introductory lecture course introduces students with little or no prior knowledge of Korea or the
Korean language to Korean society by exploring cultural codes—shared symbols, values, and practices
that shape everyday life—through the lens of media and literature. By engaging with short stories, films,
TV shows, music, and other cultural texts, students will examine how these cultural codes influence
Korean social norms, identities, and global representations.
The course focuses on six key cultural codes—food, language, family structure, religion, economic
development, and the two Koreas—as reflected in Korean literature, film, drama, and YouTube content.
Through these themes, students will gain a foundational yet comprehensive understanding of Korean
society. At the same time, they will strengthen their critical and analytical skills in interpreting culture,
cultivating a deeper awareness of how meaning is constructed and communicated across different media.

ETHNICITY, RACE, IDENTITY IN THE PRE-MODERN MIDDLE EAST
MDES2000UN
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

This seminar investigates the concepts of ethnicity, race, and identity, in both theory and practice,
through a comparative survey of several case studies from the Pre-Modern history of the Middle East.
The course focuses on symbols of identity and difference, interpreting them through a variety of
analytical tools, and evaluating the utility of each as part of an ongoing exploration of the subject. The
survey considers theories of ethnicity and race, as well as their critics, and includes cases from the
Ancient World (c. 1000 BCE) through the Old Regime (c. 1800 CE).


Students in this course will gain a familiarity with major theories of social difference and alterity, and
utilize them to interpret and analyze controversial debates about social politics and identity from the
history of the Middle East, including ancient ethnicity, historical racism, Arab identity, pluralism in the
Islamic Empire, and slavery, among others. In addition, students will spend much of the semester
developing a specialized case study of their own on a historical community of interest. All of the case
studies will be presented in a showcase at the end of the semester.


All assigned readings for the course will be in English. Primary sources will be provided in translation.
The course meets once a week and sessions are two hours long.

ANCIENT NEAR EASTERN LITERATURE
MDES2399UN
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

This colloquium is a course on many influential texts of literature from Ancient Near Eastern cultures, including Sumerian, Egyptian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Hittite, Canaanite, and others. The emphasis is on investigating the literary traditions of each culture – the subject matter, form, methods, and symbolism– that distinguish them from one another and from later traditions of the Middle East. The course is not
a “civilization” course, nor is it a history class, although elements of culture and history will be mentioned as necessary. The course is intended to provide a facility with, and an awareness of, the content and context of ancient works of literature in translation from the Ancient Middle East.


Students in this course will gain a familiarity with the major cultures of the Ancient Middle East, the best known and most remarked upon stories, and the legacy of those works on some later traditions. The course is organized thematically in order to facilitate comparison to the materials in similar courses at Barnard and Columbia. The approach will be immediately familiar to students who have previously taken Asian Humanities (AMEC) or Literature-Humanities (Core), but the course does not require any previous experience with literature or the Ancient Near East and is open to everyone.


All assigned readings for the course will be in English. The course meets once a week and sessions are two hours long.

DIVAS AND THEIR PUBLICS
MUSI2075BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

In order to exist, the female vocal celebrity needs a public. This course takes a global perspective on women’s voices, bodies, and performances, examining them in deep sociocultural contexts across a range of classical and popular music genres. Guiding questions interrogate the role of media and technology in commercializing and circulating the sounds and images of women singers on an international scale, forging new arenas for meaning-making around gender, race, and citizenship. Considering the historically, socially, and materially situated circumstances in which celebrated women performers have emerged in the modern era, the course asks: How did the expressive labor of virtuosic female singers shape the early US entertainment industry? In what ways have women singers around the world impacted nation-centered political agendas, struggles for racial equality, and other powerful religious and secular social formations? How did sound reproduction and broadcasting technology not only expand audiences on an exponential scale, but transform listeners’ experience of female singers’ live performance? Cross-culturally and throughout history, why have exceptional women vocalists had greater public impact than women instrumentalists?

The teen brain has received a lot of media coverage with advances in brain imaging techniques that
provide a voyeuristic opportunity for us to look under the hood of the behaving adolescent brain. This
course will cover empirical and theoretical accounts of adolescent-specific changes in brain and behavior
that relate to the development of self control. These accounts of adolescent brain and behavior will then
be discussed in the context of relevant legal, social and health policy issues. Lectures and discussion will
address: Under what circumstances self control appears to be diminished in adolescents. How do
dynamic changes in neural circuitry help to explain changes in self control across development? When
does the capacity for self control fully mature? Are these changes observed in other species? How might
these changes be evolutionarily adaptive and when are they maladaptive? How might understanding
adolescent brain and behavioral development inform interventions and treatments for maladaptive
behavior or inform policy for changing the environment to protect youth?

NEUROETHOLOGY
NSBV3385BC
1 section

This seminar delves into the neural circuits and molecular mechanisms responsible for natural animal behaviors (i.e. ethology). Animal models are crucial to biological research. Without fruit flies we would know little about genetic inheritance or how genes relate to fundamental behaviors, such as circadian rhythms. Without the barn owl we would not fully understand how the brain detects interaural time differences and localizes sounds. Without echolocating bats our knowledge of three-dimensional navigation and memory would be diminished. Through the study of animal systems that are specialized for particular sensory and motor acts, scientists have been able to dissect the circuit computations underlying key behaviors, such as decision making, prey detection, foraging, mate selection, and communication, that are fundamental across species. Through short introductory talks and in-depth discussions of primary scientific literature, this course will provide a foundation for understanding these behaviors, and relate discoveries in animal research to broader themes in neurobiology, ecology, and medicine.

NEUROSCIENCE OF TRAUMA
NSBV3405BC
1 section
Satisfies 3 credit Science Lecture or Lab Requirement (Barnard)

This course is a comprehensive review of the neural basis of the emotional, cognitive and behavioral responses to traumatic events.  The acute experience of trauma and the memory of the trauma may influence neural processes influencing social relatedness, attachment, emotional regulation, physiological homeostasis and the stress response.  Neuroscientific research provides insight into these processes and informs pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions for individual survivors.

Students will review neuroscientific theoretical models and research relevant to the neurobiology, neurophysiology, neuroanatomy and neurodevelopmental processes underlying the traumatic response. The neuroendocrine system and its relevance will also be reviewed.   The course will begin with a critical review of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) diagnosis of Trauma and Stressor Related Disorders, to acquire an understanding of the symptoms and diagnosis.  Next, students will review theory and research relevant to trauma and neurobiology, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology.  Finally, students will critique the application of these research findings to the design of current “neuro-informed” therapeutic interventions.  Throughout the course, individual case studies will provide insight into the brain’s influence on symptomatology and foster greater understanding and sensitivity to the personal post-traumatic experience.

Love, Gender, and Sex
PHIL2109UN
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

What does it mean to love, and what does it take to love well? Must true love make us “happy ever after”? Should love be exclusive? Is love between individuals or could it be communal and even political? How does love relate to gender and sex, and how might the experiences of queer, trans, and intersex people both complicate and illuminate these connections? What is gender anyway? How do we figure that out? Is it a mere coincidence that the English term ‘sex’ refers to both an activity and a system of categorization? How should we think about consent, desire, objectification, and sexualization in connection to sexual autonomy and gender equality? This course surveys philosophical questions about love, gender, and sex, and in so doing, aims to introduce students to the burgeoning interdisciplinary field of social philosophy.

Love, Gender, and Sex is designed to be friendly to all students regardless of philosophy background.

POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY
PHIL3751UN
1 section

Six major concepts of political philosophy including authority, rights, equality, justice, liberty and democracy are examined in three different ways. First the conceptual issues are analyzed through contemporary essays on these topics by authors like Peters, Hart, Williams, Berlin, Rawls and Schumpeter. Second the classical sources on these topics are discussed through readings from Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Marx, Plato, Mill and Rousseau. Third some attention is paid to relevant contexts of application of these concepts in political society, including such political movements as anarchism, international human rights, conservative, liberal, and Marxist economic policies as well as competing models of democracy.

Freud and Philosophy
PHIL4718GU
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

In the first half of this course we will read the major works of Freud that make up his “metapsychology.” Metapsychology is psychoanalysis’ “speculative superstructure,” the most philosophical part of psychoanalytic theory, providing a broad theoretical “standpoint” on the mind that is both informed by and guides both empirical research and clinical practice. Freud articulated four metapsychologies (dynamic, economic, topographical, and structural).  The aim will be to read Freud somewhat as we read, for example, Aristotle’s or Kant’s or Nietzsche’s moral psychology.  What are the basic theoretical posits?  What are these claims based on?  From what perspective (first-personal or third-personal) are these claims made?  How does Freud’s picture advance our own practical self-understanding? Etc.

In the second half of the course we will read some major responses to Freud in the context of philosophical moral psychology.  So we will read some critical theorists, some engagements with psychoanalytic theory regarding gender and race, and some contemporary analytic philosophers.

1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

This course considers key questions at the foundation of political thought.  What is justice?  How do we justify the coercive power of states? Do we have an obligation to obey the government? Who should make and enforce the law?  What basic rights and liberties should governments protect? How should our economic system produce and divide wealth and material resources?  What are the claims of excluded or marginalized groups and how can these claims be addressed?   We explore these questions through the works of several classical and contemporary political thinkers.  A major goal of the course is to practice the skills needed to understand a political thinker’s arguments and to construct one’s own.

BEGINNING IN FALL 2025, BARNARD STUDENTS WISHING TO TAKE POLITICAL THEORY FOR INTRO CREDIT TOWARD THE MAJOR MUST TAKE POLS-BC1110. If Barnard students enroll in POLS-UN2101, the course will only count toward their major as elective credit.

Columbia College students who take POLS-BC1110 can only apply the course toward their major for elective credit.

Students may not get credit for more than one of the following courses:  POLS BC1110, POLS UN1101, or POLS-UN2101.

INTRO TO COMPARATIVE POLITICS
POLS1510BC
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

This course provides a broad overview of the comparative politics subfield by focusing on important substantive questions about the world today. The course is organized around four questions. First, why can only some people depend upon the state to enforce order? Second, how can we account for the differences between autocracies and democracies? Third, what different institutional forms does democratic government take? Finally, are some institutions more likely than others to produce desirable social outcomes such as accountability, redistribution, and political stability?

BEGINNING IN FALL 2025, BARNARD STUDENTS WISHING TO TAKE COMPARATIVE POLITICS FOR INTRO CREDIT TOWARD THE MAJOR MUST TAKE POLS-BC1510. If Barnard students enroll in POLS-UN2501, the course will only count toward their major as elective credit.

Columbia College students who take POLS-BC1510 can only apply the course toward their major for elective credit.

Students may not get credit for more than one of the following courses:  POLS BC1510, POLS UN1501, or POLS-UN2501.

POLITICAL THEORY AT THE BORDER
POLS3003BC
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

This lecture course in political theory examines pressing questions related to borders, migration, exile, and displacement: Why do we have borders, and how are they constructed and governed? How do borders relate to political membership and rights? What can borders teach us about modern sovereign power? Are there any limits to state coercion and violence in border enforcement? In what ways do borders manifest racial hierarchies and divides within the global order? How do we rethink political responsibility in response to problems of rightlessness generated by borders? In addressing these questions, the course prioritizes borders as crucial sites for understanding and interrogating key political concepts such as sovereignty, membership, rights, and violence.

AFRICAN AMERICAN POLITICAL THOUGHT
POLS3021BC
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

This course explores the history and the present of African American political theory and practice, through an analysis of theoretical texts, pamphlets/manifestos, and popular culture from the periods of the abolitionist movement, Reconstruction, civil rights, late 20th century Black feminist thought, and contemporary Black politics and culture. This course emphasizes the way that Black activists, scholars, and/or artists have responded to eternal questions in political thought about freedom, oppression, resistance, citizenship, democracy, etc., from the standpoint of Blackness in the United States. Moreover, the course is not just African-American Political Thought, it is also American Political Thought, insofar as Black theorizations and experiences of America provides a vital framework for interrogating the American experiment, citizenship and non-citizenship, American slavery and its afterlives, inclusion and exclusion, liberation and domination, and ultimately what “America” is and what it does (and perhaps could) mean to be American.

COLL: CAPITALISM AND ITS CRITICS
POLS3048BC
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)

Capitalism is usually thought of as an economic system, but what does it have to do with politics? This course examines how thinkers of contrasting perspectives have understood capitalism politically. Some have celebrated the market as an escape from coercion, while others criticize it as a source of disguised domination; some see capitalism as leveling social hierarchies, while others point to its creation of class and racial hierarchy; some see capitalism as an engine of wealth creation and heightened living standards, while others emphasize its destruction of existing ways of life and production of inequality; some see capitalism as an engine of peace, while others emphasize its reliance on violence. In particular, we will consider the relationship between state and market, moral critiques of markets and exchange, analyses of the role of force and violence in accumulation, and theories of freedom and domination.

COLL: POLITICAL VIOLENCE & TERRORISM
POLS3055BC
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

When is violence used against noncombatants in conflicts and what is the impact of such violence? This course focuses on violence against civilians by armed organizations, whether states or non-state actors. We will examine a variety of explanations for such violence, including rationalist, psychological/emotion-based, and organizational approaches. We will also discuss the impact of political violence. Does it get the job done, so to speak? Does violence move terrorist groups closer to their goals? Does indiscriminate violence by the state spur rebellion or suppress insurgencies? Does insurgent violence against civilians make insurgencies more or less effective? While we emphasize violence intentionally causing harm to civilians we will also consider collateral damage.

 

In addition to our discussions of this literature we will explore what light selected empirical evidence might shed on our questions. You will each select a theoretical problem of interest—e.g., two competing theories, a theory that might be revised or applied in a new context—and write a paper addressing this problem on the basis of empirical research (either through qualitative case studies or quantitative analysis). Your ongoing research will be shared when relevant during our class discussions, and the final weeks of the semester will be set aside for a research workshop.

PUBLIC OPINION AND AMERICAN D
POLS3205BC
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Quantitatively and Empirically" Requirement (Barnard)
In this course, we will examine the relationship between government and the governed in the United States. To what extent and under what circumstances do elected officials consider public preferences in making policy? To what extent and under what circumstances might we want them to? What kind of power should the public have in American democracy? Thinking about the second and third, more normative questions leads us to other empirical questions. What shapes public preferences? How well can we measure them? How much do people know and care about politics? How do they evaluate their representatives? What constitutes high quality representation? We will examine these kinds of questions broadly, and also consider how they play out in particular policy areas and historical moments. We will also discuss the dynamics of public opinion across population subgroups (e.g. by race, sex, income, party, urbanity, etc.), and questions surrounding representation at the group level. In addition to engaging scholarly literature on public opinion and representation, students will also learn to access, manage, and analyze data measuring the composition of the public (e.g. the U.S. Census) as well as public views on political candidates, officeholders, institutions, and issues (e.g. survey data). These skills will help to prepare students for research projects in other courses and beyond Barnard. To balance the different aims of the course, our class time will be split between lecture, discussion, and hands-on lessons in a computer lab.

POLS3350BC
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

In the course, we will engage the decades-long debates around what it means to organize politics around identity in the United States, particularly from the lens of marginalized groups. In the age of American politics where the term “identity politics” is often used as a dismissal or derogation of the experiences of marginalized groups, what exactly is identity politics? What do the contemporary anxieties around identity politics tell us about political life? What are the political possibilities that arise from organizing identity-based movements? Does focusing too much on identity politics overshadow concerns around material redistribution? We will trace the notion of identity politics back to its origins in Black queer feminism in the 1970s, and seek to understand its evolutions to today. We will bridge the work of critical theorists with the empirical study of identity-based politics, focusing on those who have sought to negotiate differences across race, gender, and sexuality.

DEMOCRACY'S GUARDRAILS?
POLS3407BC
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

The speed and smoothness of democratic backsliding and the suddenness of democratic breakdowns tend to surprise us. We expect established institutions and parties, as well as the individuals socialized in democratic norms who populate them, to remain loyal to democracy. But instead we often see both hard and soft guardrails of democracy (institutions and norms) crumble, as various combinations of judges, capitalists, party activists, bureaucrats, military officers, and law-enforcement personnel accept and even support the actions of aspiring authoritarians. In this course we will explore why and when this happens—and also look at conditions that might prevent this from happening.

 

Our focus will be specific—not on the would-be dictators or on structural forces that might shape these processes but on those institutions and actors that might be considered the bystanders or enablers of democratic reversals. Our readings will include political science literature on democratic breakdowns and fracturing of elite consensus, political norms, and strategic games of transition, but we will also read selections of relevant histories and memoirs. We will consider cases of breakdown and backsliding from 1930s Germany to 1970s Chile to twenty-first-century Hungary, Poland, and the United States—always focusing on potential guardrails.

The course examines the development of states and nations from both historical and comparative perspectives.  It asks why states replaced other forms of political organization (empires, feudalism, warlordism) and why national identities came to replace or dominate other types of identities (religious, ethnic, local) at some times and in some places, but not others.  It explicitly compares the processes of state and nation-building in the past and the contemporary period, drawing on cases from various parts of the world.  The course also considers factors that may be undermining states and nations today.

DRUGS & POLITICS IN AMERICAS
POLS3565UN
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

A major challenge for governments across the Western Hemisphere is the complex relationship between illicit drugs, violence, and politics. We can see this relationship operating at multiple levels, from everyday politics in gang-controlled neighborhoods to the global arenas where governments debate and craft international drug policy. These links also reach back in history to global wars of empire and colonial rule, race relations during and following the collapse of the institution of slavery, and contemporary drug wars being waged across the Western Hemisphere and other parts of the world. Today, the dynamics and consequences of the politics of illicit drugs touch all our lives in different ways, including individual and family struggles with substance abuse, everyday encounters with militarized police, and the strains on democracy and citizenship, among many others. This course will examine some of these dynamics and consequences with a theoretical and empirical focus mainly on Latin America and the United States. Throughout our time together we will connect these pressing issues to broader theories, concepts and empirical findings in political science. The course is divided into several individual modules (denoted below with the headings A – G) under three overarching themes for this semester:

 

1. Politics of Drugs in a Historical Perspective: The first theme is a broad historical overview of the political origins of illicit drugs and the global drug regime. Some of the main questions we will tackle are: When and why did states label drugs as illicit?  How did domestic and global politics come together to shape the global drug regime and the “war on drugs?” What role did race and gender play in the early social construction of illicit drugs?

 

2. Illicit Drugs, Politics and Governance: The second theme focuses on contemporary linkages between illicit drugs, violence, and politics. Here we will examine the conditions under which illicit drug markets are either violent or (relatively) peaceful. We will tackle questions like: Do states always seek to dismantle drug markets? What is the relationship between illicit drugs and electoral politics? What role do illicit drugs play in governance by armed non-state actors?  Are states and criminal actors involved in the drug trade always at “war” with each other? 


3. Democracy, Citizenship, and the War on Drugs: The third and final theme centers on the political consequences of the war on drugs for questions of democracy and citizenship in the Western Hemisphere. Some of the questions that will help us make sense of these consequences are:  How does the war on drugs impact democracy and citizenship? What is the political economy of imprisonment? And in what ways do imprisonment and police-citizen interactions – stemming from the war on drugs – shape individual and collective political behavior and political subjectivity?

This course introduces students to psychological theories of international politics. We pose a series of questions about the role of individuals in international relations and consider different theories of political decision making (including rational choice, cognitive, motivational, and organizational theories), personality and leadership, and the role of images, values, and identity in shaping international behavior. We’ll put these theories in the context of other ways of explaining state behavior, evaluate their usefulness, and you’ll make use of these theories to explain an international relations course of your choosing.

COLL:POLITICS OF DEVELOPMENT
POLS3801BC
1 section
Prerequisites: V 1501 or equivalent Description: The semester-long course aims to study political and social factors behind economic development and exam empirical cases of the success and failure in economic growth in order to understand the key features of the development processes. In the last two centuries, some countries successfully achieved economic growth and development, while other failed to do so. Even in the post-WWII period, the world has witnessed the rise and decline of economies around the world. Why do nations succeed or fail in economic development? How do political institutions affect economic outcomes? What are the ways in which state and market interact and influence each other? Can democracy be considered a cause of development, an outgrowth of development, or neither and to which extent? How do external factors such as foreign aid encourage or discourage development? We will try to examine these questions by taking a historical-institutional and comparative approach and take a critical look at the role of political and other institutions by applying theoretical guidelines and empirical cases. We will explore competing explanations for the successes and failures of economic development in the world. Objective:1. Understand some important concepts and theories within the fields of comparative politics and political economy. To explore the interconnections between politics, economy, and society in the context of development policy and practice.2. Develop basic analytic skills to explore various factors that shape political, economic, and social development and underdevelopment in the world;3. Understand some country specific political economy processes and how these processes prove or disprove certain theories and policies.

The Dog
PSYC2144BC

Satisfies 3 credit Science Lecture or Lab Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Quantitatively and Empirically" Requirement (Barnard)

Who's a good dog? The history of the species (a member of which might be napping on your bed right now) is intertwined with human history since the late Pleistocene. In this lecture course we turn our gaze to the animal who is famous for their gaze toward and interest in us: the domestic dog, Canis familiaris.

Dogs are not just good bed-warmers and companions: they are also an excellent introduction into how behavioral science is conducted; an example of the rapid effect of genetic changes; and a case study in how science influences animals' social and legal roles in society. We will look at the history of the development of the species and the recent further development into hundreds of types of purebred dogs. As a domesticated species, dogs are an example of the effect of artificial selection on appearance and behavior. We will discuss the genetic markers underpinning those effects. Dogs also have had a long role in psychological science, and their history, from Pavlov's experiments to present day, traces the history of behaviorism and the cognitive revolution in the field. We will consider the perceptual world of dogs and the importance of understanding sensory capacity in study design. We will spend several weeks on highlights from recent cognitive studies of dogs demonstrating dogs' surprising capacities in areas previously thought to be solely humans' province. Working from video examples, we will learn to describe behaviors objectively, and will discuss how to develop testable hypotheses of the function of seen behavior. We will conclude the semester with a consideration of the future of dogs in science and in our lives.

PSYCHOLOGY OF DRUG USE & ABUSE
PSYC2177BC
1 section
Satisfies 3 credit Science Lecture or Lab Requirement (Barnard)

Prerequisites: BC1001 or permission of the instructor. 

The aim of this course is to critically examine the complex interaction of biological, psychological and environmental factors which impact the etiology, symptoms, and treatment of substance abuse and dependence. The course focuses on those drugs which have abuse and dependence potential with specific emphasis on Alcohol and the Depressants, the Psychostimulants, and the Opiates.  A primary objective is to provide insight into factors which contribute to challenges with substances for some individuals and to better understand their felt and lived experience with drugs.

The course begins with a review of theoretical perspectives including disease, behavioral, cognitive, social learning, psychodynamic, and neurobiological models.  The physical, psychological, and socio-cultural effects/impact of each major class of drug will then follow. Within each category, we will also discuss controversial issues related to each drug for example: methadone maintenance, needle exchange programs, Ritalin/Adderall abuse, the “opiate epidemic.”  Throughout the course, case histories, film documentaries and memoirs will provide personal accounts of the drug experience.  We conclude the course with an overview of treatment interventions.

Science of Well-Being and Human Potential
PSYC3088BC
1 section
Satisfies 3 credit Science Lecture or Lab Requirement (Barnard)

What does it mean to reach your full potential? Can science inform how you can live your own best life? The main mission of this seminar is to provide an up-to-date understanding of theoretical, empirical, and applied advances in the science of well-being and human potential. Consideration will be given to conflicting viewpoints and their respective empirical support. The course is grounded in the core principles of humanistic psychology, and will cover essential human needs, including security, growth, mindfulness, connection, self-esteem, love, creativity, character, resiliency, purpose, flow, gratitude, awe, and other forms of transcendence. We will also cover the latest science of human performance, including the development of intelligence, talent, and creativity. Throughout this seminar you will engage in experiential learning and practical exercises to further help you nurture what’s best within you— and become a whole person— which will inform our theoretical and empirical understanding of the latest scientific findings. My hope is that in addition to enhancing your appreciation of how the scientific method can increase your understanding of human potential more generally, the exercises and readings in this course will also help you in your own personal journey to realize your greatest strengths and become more fully human— accepting and becoming flexible with the totality of who you are, so that you can become the person you most want to become.

Science Writing
PSYC3144BC
1 section
Satisfies 3 credit Science Lecture or Lab Requirement (Barnard)

Even as students learn to be scientists, there is a need to learn how to write about science, translating the science for a general readership. In this seminar we will develop writing skills by, first, close reading and analysis of science writing (on research about humans, non-human animals, and non-animals) for the non-specialist, as well as some of the original research papers from which the pieces arose. We will simultaneously begin an iterative process of composing pieces of different lengths and different genres, based on recently published science papers. Assignments will include a short news summary, book review, an audio interview, and a final feature print or audio story; some of these assignments will involve multiple drafts or stages. Guest speakers and a recording practices intensive from IMATS will complement the readings and writing assignments. We will focus on concept translation, storytelling, and other elements of narrative craft in this writing-intensive seminar. We will also emphasize proper citation practices. Final projects will be a long-form feature or a podcast.

Attention
PSYC3145BC
1 section
Satisfies 3 credit Science Lecture or Lab Requirement (Barnard)

In this seminar we will examine attention, the critical cognitive process responsible for prioritizing certain information for more efficient processing while filtering out distractions. We will review attention’s effects on early to late-stage vision, how it interacts with other sensory systems, and higher cognitive functions, all while surveying some of the most common ways it’s historically been measured using psychophysical and neuroscientific methods. We will evaluate how attention has been assessed across human development, and in clinical populations, such as individuals with Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD), schizophrenia and hemispatial neglect. We will end by discussing the practical implications of our increasingly limited and divided attention when navigating the modern technological landscape, as well as review the potential for improving attention through training.

CEPHALOPOD COGNITION
PSYC3179BC
1 section
Satisfies 3 credit Science Lecture or Lab Requirement (Barnard)

This seminar is designed to introduce you to the methods used to discern and describe the cognitive repertoire of novel, understudied, animals.  The animals which we will specifically examine in the class are octopuses and cuttlefish.  Over the course of the semester you will learn how we define cognitive abilities in humans and examine them in various animal species for modeling and comparison purposes.  Each week you will examine one specific ability in humans, a traditional animal model, and a cephalopod.  In this manner you will come to understand the historical process of understanding animal cognition, the current state of the literature in at least one area of cephalopod cognition and be capable of proposing a novel experiment as a way to extend our knowledge of that area of cephalopod cognition.

There are over 800 distinct Native American nations currently within the borders of the United States. This course offers a broad introduction to the diversity of American Indian religious systems and their larger functions in communities and in history. We will explore general themes in the study of Native American religious traditions as well as look at some specific examples of practices, ideas, and beliefs. Of particular importance are the history and effects of colonialism and missionization on Native peoples, their continuing struggles for religious freedom and cultural and linguistic survival, and the ways in which American Indians engage with religion and spirituality, both past and present, to respond to social, cultural, political, and geographical change.

This course courses engages the interdisciplinary study of religion online and provides practical training to students on developing digital humanities projects, in partnership with the Digital Humanities Center and the Empirical Reasoning Center, and will incorporate analysis and critical reflection into their research on religious communities. The first portion of the course focuses on understanding methodologies in studying digital religion and exploring religious communities online. Case studies focus on ascriptive and affirmative identifications of religious communities, including how religious communities use online space to redefine their public
perceptions. The latter part of the course utilizes tools of digital humanities to develop projects responsive to student interests and that allows them to analyze digital expressions of religion.

More than Real: Dreams, Imagination, and Virtual Reality in South Asian Religions
RELI3096BC
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

This course is thematic, though a loose history of dreaming, imaginative praxis, and virtual reality environments across South Asia will emerge through the networked conversations across texts. The advantage of a thematic course allows us to cover various genres such as: ritual manuals; epic; poetry; philosophical argument; biographical accounts; prophecies; conversion stories; and medical textbooks to name a handful. At the end of the course, we will see how the texts encountered in the first part have been repurposed to speak to social justice movements around caste - both within South Asia and the diaspora population in the U.S. The thematic of dreaming and imagination also provides flexibility in method: because students will have the opportunity to study conversations between different historical actors across religious traditions about dreams, they will also have the opportunity to revise problematic accounts of religious pluralism and communalism in South Asia. Students will read primary texts from Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, Zoroastrian, and Sikh traditions to name a handful. Students can look forward to reading about worlds within rocks; falling asleep and waking up as another person only to die in the dream world, wake up and then realize your dream-life family is somehow real and looking for you; how to finally interpret those pesky dreams about teeth falling out; dismembered bodies generating the universe; daydreaming about a cloud that thinks mountain peaks look like nipples; how to build a mind-temple that Shiva prefers to the physical one with fancy rock; and much more!

This course conceives of the Qur’ān as a living text in constant flux through interactions with other religious traditions.  It focuses on developing an understanding of the Qur’ān’s form, style, and content through a  close reading of comparable religious texts.  Major topics covered include the Qur’ānic theory of prophecy, its treatment of the Biblical tradition (both that of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament), and its perspective on pre-Islamic pagan religion.  The central goals of the course include the ability to (a) analyze primary religious sources in a critical and objective manner and (b) construct coherent arguments based on concrete evidence.   In a class of this nature, class members will naturally hold or develop a wide variety of opinions about the topics covered.  The goal is not to adopt a single opinion concerning the interpretation of a particular text, but rather to support personal conclusions in a clear logical manner.

Religion and Medicine in South Asia: Psychiatry & the Politics of Madness

1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

In this course, students will come to see the imbrication of religion, power, and mental illness across South Asia by examining experiences of suffering and its management; the history of psychiatry in the British colonial era and its afterlives; and the relationship of religion to concepts of mental and emotional disorder. Students will identify models for medical structures of care, healing, and treatments in the context of religion, ritual, and quotidian life. Topics include diagnostic processes and the creation of categories, stigma and models of clinical care, hysteria, spirit possession, pharmaceuticals, and the relationship of trauma to political structures. This course has three sections: 1) the first portion undertakes a brief historical survey of medical disciplines and institutions in South Asia (such as the development of Ayurveda, Yunānī Ṭibb, and the rise of the bīmāristān); 2) the second portion of the course focuses on the rise of the asylum (sometimes called the pāgal khāna) in tandem with psychiatry and its twinned consequence: the pathologization of asceticism by British colonial technologies of discipline; 3) the final portion examines the relationship between British colonialism and psychoanalysis with the introduction of this western discipline to the subcontinent. 

This course will take critical stock of historical structures throughout South Asia claiming to provide care (such as family, caste, healthcare, mental asylums, colonialism, educational systems, pensions, and much more). As a result, students come to consider concepts of social suffering, biopolitics, biosociality, political subjectivity, and postcolonial disorder. 

Primary source material will include the following: śāstra, ethnography, clinical studies, poetry, scripture, ritual texts across Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions.

What is the source of truth and authority? What is the origin of the world and how does that determine the social order? Who ought to rule, why, and how? What are the standards for measuring justice and injustice? What is our relationship to the environment around us and how should its resources be distributed among people? How do we relate to those who are different from us, and what does it mean to be a community in the first place? Historically, the answers to these questions that have been described as “religious” and “political” have been the restricted to a specific tradition of Western European Christianity and its secular afterlives. However, these are questions that every society asks, in order to be a society in the first place. This course analyzes how indigenous peoples in the Americas asked and answered these questions through the first three centuries of Western European imperial rule. At the same time, this course pushes students to question what gets categorized as uniquely “indigenous” thought, how, and why.

American Scriptures
RELI4324GU
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

What is scripture? How is cannon created? How do particular communities find meaning in varying works of literature? In this seminar, we will explore a number of influential American texts not simply in order to understand how they address questions of the holy and divine presence but also for how they provide creative ways of considering questions that have dogged Americans for centuries. In so doing, we will place literary works in conversation with contemporary theological trends and present-day scholarship on these connections. The course’s main thematic focus will be on government and collective rights; racial difference and questions of theodicy; children’s literature and disciplinary formation; the American libertarian streak; how best to care for the self; and humanity’s connection to nature. Students will examine a variety of texts – from the Declaration of Independence to Carl Sagan and Moby Dick – to better understand what matters to Americans and what do the literary artifacts we leave behind say about our current civilizational moment.

This course will have succeeded in its goals if by its end your operative definition of religion has been significantly jumbled, challenged, and complicated. While many of our historical actors will use the term in different ways, this course is invested not in identifying what is or is not properly “religious,” but rather in examining how ideas operate in the world for the people to whom they’re important. To a certain extent, we must take seriously the claims made by religious actors of God acting in their lives. But in terms of analysis, religion for us will be a fluid concept, one that evades simple definition, and that is always “real” in terms of its effects on belief, action, and identity.

Science-based evidence in policymaking
SCPP3338BC
1 section
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

In all societies, public policies are developed to solve social problems such as extreme
poverty, inequality, basic sanitation, health and basic care, family planning, food
security, mental health, abuse of illegal substances, education and protection of
vulnerable groups. How can we ensure that these public policies are based on solid
evidence, which would guarantee the greatest probability of effectiveness? And how do
we plan and adapt the implementation of these policies to different realities, respecting
cultural and historical differences?


In order to achieve this, it is useful, if not necessary, to be acquainted with scientific
thinking and the accumulation and use of evidence. It is also necessary to understand
our own limitations and cognitive biases that interfere in the decision-making process,
as well as understand the political and social context where decisions need to be made.
This course aims to provide students with the tools necessary to assess public policies
critically and rationally, as well as to evaluate different types of scientific evidence and
understand how and where it is appropriate to include scientific evidence in building
effective public policy.

The course addresses the works of women writers of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia from the 19th century to the present. All assigned readings will be in English. The purpose of the course is to become familiar with the struggles and concerns of these authors, as well as the general features of their lives and cultural contexts. Most readings assigned are primary texts. These will be supplemented during course meetings: the instructor will bring in various materials that would be obscure if assigned to students outside of class, but with live explanations in-class, will enrich their understanding of the primary readings.

Structural Drivers of Health

Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Locally - New York City" Requirement (Barnard)

The COVID-19 pandemic has made the underlying health disparities that exist in the United States more apparent. The traditional biomedical model places the responsibility of these disparities on the choices that an individual makes. The model assumes that one’s smoking, eating and exercising habits are based on personal choice. Therefore, the prevalence of morbidities such as high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes is the result of an individual’s poor decisions. This course will explore how the conditions under which individuals live, work, play and pray impact their health outcomes. Collectively these conditions are referred to as the Social Drivers of Health (SDoH) and often they reveal the systemic inequalities that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. This course will also call upon the need for a paradigm shift from the "Social" "Determinants" of Health to the “Structural” "Drivers" of Health. This shift is in recognition that it is the underlying structures (laws, material infrastructure) that impact  and drive health outcomes. The development of the SDoH has challenged health care providers to look beyond the biomedical model that stresses an individual’s behavior as the main predictor of adverse health conditions. Instead the SDoH focuses on an “upstream” approach that examines the underlying systemic and racial inequalities that impact communities of color and their health outcomes.

Examines the ways sociologists have studied the field of medicine and experiences of health and illness. We cannot understand topics of health and illness by only looking at biological phenomena; we must consider a variety of social, political, economic, and cultural forces. Uses sociological perspectives and methods to understand topics such as: unequal patterns in health and illness; how people make sense of and manage illness; the ways doctors and patients interact with each other; changes in the medical profession, health policies and institutions; social movements around health; and how some behaviors but not others become understood as medical problems. Course is geared towards pre-med students as well as those with general interests in medicine, health and society.

This course explores the sociology and history of race and racism, ethnicity and ethnocentrism, and unequal access to education in the United States through readings, films, audio, and multimedia. Experiences of students in public and private K-12 schools, colleges and universities, and alternative and informal educational settings will be considered. Movements by students and communities to fight discrimination and injustice, demand equal opportunities and resources, and to realize the promise of education as a means of achieving personal and collective liberation will also be examined. Case studies may include: boarding schools for Indigenous children; Reconstruction-era public schools; the settlement house movement; Freedom Schools of the Civil Rights Movement; the Black Panther Party’s educational initiatives; community-controlled schools; Black, Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and Ethnic Studies programs; urban educational reform, public school closures, and charter schools; the school-to-prison pipeline; standardized testing and advanced placement courses; and more.

Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

As novel technologies become increasingly enmeshed in our daily lives—and even intertwined with human consciousness—it is all the more necessary that we reflect critically on the social relations that produce, are embodied in, and are in turn produced by these technologies. This course will provide students an opportunity to begin unveiling those social relations via a wide-ranging introduction to the growing interdisciplinary field of Science, Technology, and Society (STS) studies. While course readings will especially emphasize sociological approaches, we will also draw on the history and philosophy of science, film, and literature. Questions we will explore include: How are social categories and hierarchies embedded in the structure and function of new technologies? What is the relationship between technological change and social transformation? Have scientific knowledge and technology liberated us, or could they do so in the future?

Sociology of Disability
SOCI3267BC
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

Drawing on sociological theory and disability studies scholarship, this course explores how societies construct meanings of disability, normalcy, and difference, and how these constructions influence social institutions, policies, and everyday interactions. Through critical analysis of key institutions—e.g. education, work, and the criminal justice system—students will examine how ableism operates at structural levels while also exploring disability rights movements and forms of resistance and agency. Many of these issues will be examined through an intersectional lens, analyzing how disability intersects with race, gender, class, and other identities to create complex experiences of privilege and marginalization.

This research and writing-intensive seminar is designed for senior majors with a background and interest in the sociology of gender and sexuality. The goal of the seminar is to facilitate completion of the senior requirement (a 25-30 page paper) based on ;hands on; research with original qualitative data. Since the seminar will be restricted to students with prior academic training in the subfield, students will be able to receive intensive research training and guidance through every step of the research process, from choosing a research question to conducting original ethnographic and interview-based research, to analyzing and interpreting ones findings. The final goal of the course will be the production of an original paper of standard journal-article length. Students who choose to pursue their projects over the course of a second semester will have the option of revisiting their articles further for submission and publications.

This seminar will investigate efforts to coordinate, justify, and understand global activism through lenses of internationalism, solidarity, and universal human rights. We will also study transformations in the global institutional landscape – comprising international finance, supranational unions, and non-governmental organizations – which is itself the contradictory outcome of prior cycles of contestation. We will survey historical precedents, analyze contemporary manifestations, and speculate on the future prospects of global activism. Students will explore cases and concepts by reading scholarly literature and by considering the political practices, texts, and media created by movements themselves.

Focus is on debates within and across Black communities regarding how Black people should seek individual and collective capacity to realize their citizenship rights and privileges, with particular attention to variation in Black Americans’ interests across the class spectrum. The final two weeks are devoted to Black liberation and reparations movements.

This class will examine the development of education for African Americans in the United States. Chattel slavery and its afterlives are marked by questions, debates, and experiments not simply in schooling for Black people, but how to use education for the practice of freedom. Through examining this development, students will learn how the experience of Black people in schools complicates static notions about public vs private schools, demands for school desegregation, and the ongoing role of (mostly) white philanthropy in shaping the development of education for Black youth in the US and around the world.

Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

One of the glaring forms of inequalities that persists today is the race-based gap in access to health care, quality of care, and health outcomes. This course examines how institutionalized racism and the structure of health care contributes to the neglect and sometimes abuse of racial and ethnic minorities. Quite literally, how does race affect one’s life chances? This course covers a wide range of topics related to race and health, including: racial inequalities in health outcomes, biases in medical institutions, immigration status and health, racial profiling in medicine, and race in the genomic era.

3 sections
Satisfies Language Requirement (Barnard)

Prerequisites: SPAN UN1108 or scoring at this level on the department’s Spanish as a Heritage Language Placement test (https://columbia-barnard.vega-labs.com).

The principal aim of SPAN UN2108 is to build upon and further develop the knowledge of Spanish that heritage learners bring to the classroom – from SPAN UN1108 and/or from family and neighborhood exposure to the language. This course cultivates intermediate-level formal speaking, listening, reading, and writing abilities.

Spanish heritage language courses at Columbia/Barnard focus on the development of communicative abilities and literacy from sociolinguistic and sociocultural approaches. Throughout the semester, students will be reviewing spelling patterns, building vocabulary, acquiring and effectively using learning strategies, and strengthening composition skills in Spanish. Cultural projects and readings reinforce learners’ understanding of the multiple issues related to Hispanic cultures in the United States and in other Spanish-speaking societies.

The goal of the course is to study some key moments of this trajectory through the analysis of representative texts, documents, and works of art.

Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

This course surveys Latin American literary texts that have deeply engaged with disability in the
20 th and 21 st century. Against the tendency to treat disability merely as a useful metaphor or to
simply import Global Northern vocabulary and methodologies of disability studies to other
locations, this course turns to Latin American literary texts by authors that have been directly
“touched” by disability to foreground the concerns, vocabularies, and commitments that their
texts reveal. This includes authors who either through their personal experience with disability
or as caretakers—as parents, siblings, or close friends of people with disabilities—have closely
grappled with the experience of non-normative bodies and minds in the Latin American
context. In this course we ask how are subjects with disabilities represented in a variety of
genres (novel, essay, poem, graphic novel) and what constraints and possibilities circumscribe
these subjectivities and their lives. Ultimately, we will ask what vision of disability justice
emerges from these localized experiences and creative interventions beyond now globalized
disability discourses of inclusion/access and independence/autonomy.

PERFORMING GREEK TRAGEDY ON THE MODERN STAGE
THTR3008UN
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)

This course aims to explore performing Greek tragedy on the modern stage. It will include an introduction to original performance practices in ancient Greece (space, masking, choral performance, costume, acting techniques) and an examination of how artists from different contemporary theatrical traditions have adapted ancient texts in modern performances and new versions of the plays. The bulk of the course will be focused on the problems of acting, interpreting, and reinterpreting parts of three plays on the stage, Sophocles’ Antigone, Euripides’ Medea, and Sophocles’ Ajax along with a new version by Ellen McLaughlin, who teaches playwriting at Barnard, Ajax in Iraq. Students will view all or parts of particularly interesting recent productions from various theatrical traditions, which will help them to tackle challenging issues such as choral performance and choral rhythms, masking, character work, dialogues and presenting formal political debates.

For contemporary actors training in Greek tragedy offers a unique opportunity to improve their performance on stage through ensemble work and representing character through speech.  It enhances dramaturgical capacities that a contemporary theater practitioner must exercise in exploring theory in practice and vice versa.

This class is directed to students particularly interested in dramaturgy, directing, designing, translation, and Greek tragedy as well as acting.

POSTCOLONIAL DRAMA:THE CANON & ITS OTHER
THTR3157UN
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

This class is a close reading of postcolonial plays, both as they form a recognizable canon, and as counters to it. Through a grounding in postcolonial theory, students will explore how the colonial encounter leaves a lasting impact on language and performance. How do these playwrights tackle questions of authenticity, influence, inspiration and agency? What stories do they adapt, translate or reimagine? Also, we read in equal measure male and female playwrights, attending to the ways in which power and authority are negotiated by them. This class looks both at plays that are seminal to postcolonial writing and also newer ones that unsettle the position of the greats. Do we then understand postcolonialism as a historically bound literary trend or an ongoing process of exploration? Fundamentally we ask, in our efforts to decolonize the theatre, how do we find new ways or reading?  Course fulfills lecture/seminar in drama studies, theatre studies, performance studies requirement for Theatre major.

This course is intended to be both an interdisciplinary introduction to the city and to the field of Urban Studies. As an introduction to the city, the course will address a variety of questions: What is a city? How did cities develop? How do cities function socially, politically, and economically? Why do people live in cities? What are some of the major issues facing cities in the early twenty-first century, and how can cities address these issues? As an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies, the course will present models of how scholars approach cities from a variety of disciplinary viewpoints, including architecture, planning, law, sociology, history, archaeology, anthropology, political science, public policy, and geography. Students will learn some of the major concepts in the field of Urban Studies, and will study the works of leading scholars in the field. Students in the course will approach cities from a number of disciplines, not only through the reading, but also through assignments that take place in different locations throughout New York City.

INTRODUCTION TO URBAN PLANNING
URBS2520UN
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

This course is a basic introduction to the field and practice of urban planning in the United States. The course will focus on key concepts in planning history, theory, and practice, including the various conflicts and dilemmas planners face, stakeholders involved in urban planning, and the tools and methods that planners use to address challenges in the built environment.

The core questions that this class will return to throughout the semester are: How does planning take place, and whose interest(s) does planning serve? How does planning (re)produce social inequities? Planning is often framed as a technical exercise to rationalize the built environment and create more “livable” cities. However, planning is not value-neutral. As we will examine throughout the course of the semester, power relations fundamentally shape the planning profession, and planning decisions have contributed to racial, economic, and gender inequalities and spatial segregation in cities throughout the United States. We will also explore debates about how to encourage more inclusive cities and engage in more ethical planning practice.

The course is divided into six sections. In Part I, we will explore foundational concepts in urban planning, such as how previous scholars have defined urban planning and urban space. In Part II, we will explore the historical context in which the planning profession emerged and key moments in planning history. In Part III, we will examine normative models of planning, or how the planning profession conceives of itself. In Part IV, we will learn about the different technical tools that planners use to regulate urban development and key debates surrounding these tools. In Part V, we will interrogate the role of the planner, the role of power relations in planning, and how planning decisions have resulted in racial, class, and gender exclusion in the built environment. In Part VI, we will contemplate future directions in planning.

URBAN LATIN/X AMERICA: ETHNOGRAPHIC APPROACHES
URBS3252UN
1 section
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

This seminar examines the social, economic, and political landscapes of Latin American cities through ethnographic literature. It explores key themes such as migration, urban poverty, marginality, violence, informality, urban segregation, grassroots movements, urban citizenship and neoliberal urban governance. Students will read both classic and contemporary ethnographies to gain an in-depth understanding of how cities are lived and experienced. The course also unsettles the category of Latin America, to introduce a discussion of the “Latinization” of U.S. cities. We will interrogate ethnographic and audiovisual materials (included to complement the readings) from a postcolonial perspective.  We will discuss the politics of knowledge production and representation in ethnographic studies and popular culture, the impact of colonialism in transnational flows of knowledge and labor, as well as the contributions to urban theory from the perspective of cities located in the Global South.

Many people don’t think of themselves as having attended segregated schools. And yet, most of us went to schools attended primarily by people who looked very much like us. In fact, schools have become more segregated over the past 30 years, even as the country becomes increasingly multiracial. In this class, we will use public schools as an example to examine the role race plays in shaping urban spaces and institutions. We will begin by unpacking the concept of racialization, or the process by which a person, place, phenomenon, or characteristic becomes associated with a certain race. Then, we will explore the following questions: What are the connections between city schools and their local contexts? What does it mean to be a “neighborhood school”? How do changes in neighborhoods change schools? We will use ethnographies, narrative non-fiction, and educational research to explore these questions from a variety of perspectives. You will apply what you have learned to your own experiences and to current debates over urban policies and public schools. This course will extend your understanding of key anthropological and sociological perspectives on urban inequality in the United States, as well as introduce you to critical theory.

This class explores how racism and racialized capitalism and politics shape the distribution of material resources among cities and suburbs in metropolitan areas and the racial and ethnic groups residing in them. Readings and discussion focus on the history of metropolitan area expansion and economic development, as well as contemporary social processes shaping racial and ethnic groups’ access to high-quality public goods and private amenities. We address racial and ethnic groups’ evolving political agendas in today’s increasingly market-driven socio-political context, noting the roles of residents; federal, state, and local governments; market institutions and actors; urban planners, activist organizations, foundations, and social scientists, among others. Here is a sample of specific topics: race/ethnicity and who “belongs” in what “place;” inequitable government and market investment across racial and ethnic communities over time and “sedimentation effects” (for example, the “redlining” of Black communities leading to their inability to access loan and credit markets and the resulting wealth gap between Blacks and Whites); gentrification processes; creating sufficient, sustainable tax bases; and suburban sprawl. Assignments will include two short response papers, mid-term and final exams, and another project to be determined.

We live in an increasingly urbanized world. But what does it mean to be “urban”? As urbanization reaches more corners of the globe, its forms and processes become increasingly diverse. Urban Elsewheres is dedicated to investigating this diversity and to exploring the implications that unfamiliar urban phenomena might have for how we understand urbanization—both elsewhere in the world and in our own backyards. Through a comparative engagement with case studies drawn from around the world, this course will challenge some of our most deeply held, common sense assumptions about urbanization. Students will be asked to stretch the conceptual limits of urbanization and explore the social and political possibilities of an expanded urbanism. In doing so, the course will engage with the many of the most heated theoretical debates about urbanization, equipping students with a set of comparative analytical tools with which to explore the wider field of urban studies.

URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE: GENDER, RACE, CLASS AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Sustainability Focused

In this course we will explore urban environmental inequalities through the lens of environmental justice.  The concept of environmental justice has risen in prominence in the language of environmental activism, politics, and policymaking. Informed by critical studies of the environment, we will address the broad question of why, for some, the environment is representational of a healthy lifestyle and source of prosperity, while for others it is a source of risk and harm. Our course of study invites students to critically analyze environmental justice case studies and to develop an understanding of the complex relationships among urban populations and the social, political, and economic processes that lead to environmental inequality. We will also explore how racism is foundational to environmental exploitation and consider why global struggles for racial justice are crucial for protecting both people and the earth. We will pay particular attention to how environmental health inequalities are linked to race, class, gender, and nation. Drawing from academic texts, films, and photo essays we will explore how urban planning and economic development policies create environmental inequalities in the US and globally.

ADVANCED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS
URBS4000GU
1 section

Prerequisite: Successful completion of URBS UN2200 Introduction to GIS Methods, or equivalent with instructor permission.

With the veritable explosion of urban data alongside the continued proliferation of new tools for its consideration, this course allows students to develop specialized approaches to spatial analysis while introducing a series of common advanced techniques and nuanced methodological questions. Aimed at covering a variety of topics with immediate relevance to urbanism in practice and in research, the course operates with a two-fold mission: (1) to critically discuss the theories, concepts, and research methods involved in spatial analysis and (2) to learn the techniques necessary for engaging those theories and deploying those methods. The class will work to meet this mission with a dedicated focus on the urban environment and the spatial particularities and relationships that arise from the urban context.

Among others, this course takes as a foundational premise that spatial analysis within geographic information systems is an incredibly powerful and double-edged weapon: it provides both the methods for answering complex spatial questions and the means for effectively communicating the results. Like any other weapon it can serve many ends, and as such an advanced course in spatial analysis must frame its use within the developing discourse on professional practice and responsibility.

The course is designed with a combination format. Early weeks are predominantly lecture-style presentations supplemented with discussion and technical demonstration and exercises. Students are expected to complete these exercises outside of class (as homework), bringing their questions to our discussion. The latter half of the course is a project-based seminar. Seminar-style presentation and discussion will rely heavily on student participation and preparation to consider the variety of spatial methods available and their implications on urban research and intervention. Woven throughout the semester is the development of a self-driven research project, through which students will engage and compare the methodological advantages and disadvantages of several assumptions, approaches, analyses, and datasets.

This introductory course for the Interdisciplinary Concentration or Minor in Race and Ethnicity (ICORE/MORE) as well as Majors/Minors in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) is open to all students. We focus on the critical study of social difference as an interdisciplinary practice, using texts with diverse modes of argumentation and evidence to analyze social differences as fundamentally entangled and co-produced. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of this course, the professor will frequently be joined by other faculty and guest speakers who bring distinct disciplinary and subject matter expertise. Some keywords for this course include hybridity, diaspora, borderlands, migration, and intersectionality.

AFFECT AND ACTIVISM
WMST3138BC
1 section
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

From love to anger to disappointment to hope, political activism mobilizes emotions towards certain ends but also generates new affective states and feelings along the way. This advanced seminar will familiarize students with feminist, anti-racist and queer scholarship on affect, feelings and emotion as intrinsic to politics and as crucial for understanding how political thought and action unfold in contingent and often unexpected ways. Mixing theoretical and cultural texts with case studies, we will look at how affect permeates structures of power and domination, embodiment and identity, and collective activist projects concerned with gender and sexual liberation. Students will have an opportunity to read theories of affect as well as to “read” activist movements for affect by working with archival documents (such as zines, manifestos, and movement ephemera) and other primary sources (such as memoir, photography and documentary film).

GENDERED CONTROVERSIES
WMST3504BC
1 section

Love and sex have long been studied as historical constructs influenced by social, political, and economic dimensions. This course aims to expand this discourse by incorporating the often-overlooked lens of technological mediation. Beginning with the premise that romantic love is deeply shaped by the affordances of the technology of the time, a critical awareness of technological mediation in romance –especially of digital technologies, i.e. online dating, social media, or cybersex— allows for a deeper understanding of how social categories such as gender, race, class, ability, or sexuality are technologically-mediated, thereby informing our societal and cultural perceptions of love, dating, and sex. 

 

Sandra Moyano-Ariza is Term Assistant Professor of WGSS and Research Director at BCRW. Her research works at the intersection of pop culture, philosophy, and digital technologies, with interests in the fields of media studies and digital scholarship, contemporary feminist theory, critical race theory, posthumanism, and affect theory.

The Scholar and Feminist Conference: Feminist Knowledge and Action at the University’s Edge
WMST3589BC
1 section
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking with Historical Perspective" Requirement (Barnard)

For fifty years, the Barnard Center for Research on Women’s Scholar and Feminist conference has provided a vital forum for leading feminist thinkers to test ideas and ignite debates on the most pressing issues of their time. This course offers a special opportunity for students to engage with the Scholar and Feminist at a historic moment: in February 2026, BCRW will host the 50th conference. We will use the history of the Scholar and Feminist conference as a guide to trace the making of feminist knowledge over the past fifty years. In addition to reading about the scholarly context of the conference, students will do archival work in preparation for attending and analyzing the anniversary gathering. Students will engage with key feminist debates that have been part of the conference’s history. They will consider how conferences function as spaces of research production and movement-building, exploring how the lessons of past controversies and solidarities can inform feminist scholarship and action in the present. Readings will draw from BCRW’s Scholar & Feminist Online and the Barnard archives, alongside key theoretical feminist texts, to consider how movements, controversies, and institutional struggles have shaped the field. Together, we will ask: how has the conference created new possibilities for scholarship and activism, and why are these questions urgent in a moment when feminist knowledge and institutions are under attack?

BLACK GEOGRAPHIES
WMST4210GU
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies Social Science Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)

Far from obvious renderings of place, maps are spatial arguments about who belongs where and how living should be defined. This course approaches place as something that is contested daily in the U.S. through the struggle of who gets to lay claim to a way of life. From the landscapes of dispossession to the alternative ways marginalized people work with and against traditional geographies, this course centers Black place-making practices as political struggle. This class will look at how power and domination become a landed project. We will critically examine how ideas about “nature” are bound up with notions of race, and the way “race” naturalizes the proper place for humans and non-human others. We will interrogate settler colonialism’s relationships to mapping who is and isn’t human, the transatlantic slave trade as a project of terraforming environments for capital, and land use as a science for determining who “owns” the earth. Centered on Black feminist, queer and trans thinkers, we will encounter space not as a something given by maps, but as a struggle over definitions of the human, geography, sovereignty, and alternative worlds. To this end, we will read from a variety of disciplines, such as Critical Black Studies, Feminist and Intersectional Science Studies, Black Geographies and Ecologies, Urban Studies and Afrofuturist literature. (Note: this class will count as an elective for the CCIS minors/concentrations in F/ISTS, ICORE/MORE, and Environmental Humanities.)

CONTEM AMER JEWISH WOMEN'S LIT
WMST4310GU
1 section

The seminar will focus on trends that have emerged over the past three decades in Jewish American women's writing in the fields of memoirs, fiction and Jewish history: the representation and exploration through fictive narratives of women's experiences in American Jewish orthodox communities; reinterpretation of Jewish history through gender analysis; the recording of migration and exile by Jewish women immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Morocco, Iran, and Egypt; and gender transformations. Texts will be analyzed in terms of genre structures, narrative strategies, the role of gender in shaping content and Jewish identity, and the political, cultural and social contexts in which the works were created. The course aims for students to discuss and critically engage with texts in order to develop the skills of analytical and abstract thinking, as well as the ability to express that critical thinking in writing. Prerequisites: Both one introductory WGSS course and Critical Approaches to Social and Cultural Theory, or Permission of the Instructor.

This course explores transcontinental connections across Africa, Asia, and the Americas as
forged in the practices and movements of peoples, in the context of global colonial and
postcolonial orders. We will consider the intersections, crossings, and collaborations of
different communities of the global South across these continents in the course of their social,
cultural, and political struggles to shape and transform the worlds they live in. We will ask, how
might different narratives of these global South connections contribute to our imagination and
practice of global resistance and transformation? Topics include: colonialism, capitalism,
imperialism, Third Worldism, feminism.

EMBODIMENT AND BODILY DIFFERENCE
WMST4325GU
1 section

At once material and symbolic, our bodies exist at the intersection of multiple competing discourses, including the juridical, the techno-scientific, and the biopolitical. In this course, we will draw upon a variety of critical interdisciplinary literatures—including feminist and queer studies, science and technology studies, and disability studies—to consider some of the ways in which the body is constituted by such discourses, and itself serves as the substratum for social relations. Among the key questions we will consider are the following: What is natural about the body? How are distinctions made between presumptively normal and pathological bodies, and between psychic and somatic experiences?  How do historical and political-economic forces shape the perception and meaning of bodily difference? And most crucially: how do bodies that are multiply constituted by competing logics of gender, race, nation, and ability offer up resistance to these and other categorizations?

SWANA Diasporas: Culture, Politics and Identity Formation in a Time of War
WMST4330GU
1 section
Satisfies Arts and Humanities Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking About Social Difference" Requirement (Barnard)
Satisfies "Thinking Through Global Inquiry" Requirement (Barnard)

In this class we will study South-West Asian and North African (SWANA) diasporic populations, social movements and cultural production that have responded to the multi-faceted ramifications of the 21st century war on terror. We will focus on diverse Arab, Iranian, and Afghan diasporas in the United States, where 19th and 20th century legacies of racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and Orientalism combined in new ways to target these groups after the September 11th, 2001 attacks. Drawing on an interdisciplinary array of texts, including ethnography, fiction, feminist and queer theory, social movement theory, and visual and performance art, we will look at how the “war on terror” has shaped the subjectivities and self-representation of SWANA communities. Crucially, we will examine the gender and sexual politics of Islamophobia and racism and study how scholars, activists and artists have sought to intervene in dominant narratives of deviance, threat, and backwardness attributed to Muslim and other SWANA populations. This course takes up the politics of naming, situating the formation of “SWANA” as part of an anti-colonial genealogy that rejects imperial geographies such as “Middle East.” We will ask how new geographies and affiliations come into being in the context of open-ended war, and what new political identities and forms of cultural production then become possible.

Labor and Life: Critiques of Capitalism
WMST4905GU
1 section

This advanced seminar examines materialist conceptions of labor and life as approached through feminist, black, anti-racist, indigenous, queer, postcolonial, and Marxist perspectives. We will trace the ways that labor and life as well as their constitutive relations have been understood in historical and contemporary radical critiques of capitalism, with a focus on gender, race and sexuality as analytical categories for understanding their shifting roles in structures and practices of social reproduction, the production and expropriation of value, the logic and exercise of violence, the organization of sociality and culture, and the practice and imagination of freedom, justice, and new forms and potentials of collective existence. Finally, we will consider the limits and possibilities of different conceptions of “material life” for understanding politics today.
