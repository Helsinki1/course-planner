ATOMISTIC SIMULATIONS FOR SCIENCE AND EN
CHEN4880E
2 sections

Many materials properties and chemical processes are governed by atomic-scale phenomena such as phase transformations, atomic/ionic transport, and chemical reactions. Thanks to progress in computer technology and methodological development, now there exist atomistic simulation approaches for the realistic modeling and quantitative prediction of such properties. Atomistic simulations are therefore becoming increasingly important as a complement for experimental characterization, to provide parameters for meso- and macroscale models, and for the in-silico discovery of entirely new materials. This course aims at providing a comprehensive overview of cutting-edge atomistic modeling techniques that are frequently used both in academic and industrial research and engineering. Participants will develop the ability to interpret results from atomistic simulations and to judge whether a problem can be reliably addressed with simulations. The students will also obtain basic working knowledge in standard simulation software.

CLIMATE PHYSICS
EESC3109UN
1 section
Satisfies Science Requirement (Columbia College and General Studies)

This is a calculus-based treatment of climate system physics and the mechanisms of anthropogenic climate change. By the end of this course, students will understand: how solar radiation and rotating fluid dynamics determine the basic climate state, mechanisms of natural variability and change in climate, why anthropogenic climate change is occurring, and which scientific uncertainties are most important to estimates of 21st century change.

This course is designed for undergraduate students seeking a quantitative introduction to climate and climate change science. EESC V2100 (Climate Systems) is not a prerequisite, but can also be taken for credit if it is taken before this course.

COMPUTATIONAL POROMECHANICS
ENME6320E
1 section

A fluid infiltrating porous solid is a multiphase material whose mechanical behavior is significantly influenced by the pore fluid. Diffusion, advection, capillarity, heating, cooling, and freezing of pore fluid, buildup of pore pressure, and mass exhanges among solid and fluid constituents all influence the stability and integrity of the solid skeleton, causing shrinkage, swelling, fracture, or liquefaction. These coupling phenomena are important for numerous disciplines, including geophysics, biomechanics, and material sciences. Fundamental principles of poromechanics essential for engineering practice and advanced study on porous media. Topics include balance principles, Biot’s poroelasticity, mixture theory, constitutive modeling of path independent and dependent multiphase materials, numerical methods for parabolic and hyperbolic systems, inf-sup conditions, and common stabilization procedures for mixed finite element models, explicit and implicit time integrators, and operator splitting techniques for poromechanics problems.

SIMULATION MODELING AND ANALYSIS
IEOR3404E
1 section

It is strongly advised that Stochastic modeling (IEOR E3106 or IEOR E4106) be taken before this course. This is an introductory course to simulation, a statistical sampling technique that uses the power of computers to study complex stochastic systems when analytical or numerical techniques do not suffice. The course focuses on discrete-event simulation, a general technique used to analyze a model over time and determine the relevant quantities of interest. Topics covered in the course include the generation of random numbers, sampling from given distributions, simulation of discrete-event systems, output analysis, variance reduction techniques, goodness of fit tests, and the selection of input distributions. The first half of the course is oriented toward the design and implementation of algorithms, while the second half is more theoretical in nature and relies heavily on material covered in prior probability courses. The teaching methodology consists of lectures, recitations, weekly homework, and both in-class and take-home exams. Homework almost always includes a programming component for which students are encouraged to work in teams.

The last decade of 20 th century witnessed a rapid convergence of three C’s: Communications, Computers, and Consumer Electronics. This convergence has given us the Internet, smart phones, and an abundance of data with Data Science playing a major role in analyzing these data and providing predictive analytics that lead to actionable items in many fields and businesses. Finance is a field with a large amount of information and data that can utilize the skills of Data Scientists, however, to be effective in this field a data scientist, in addition to analytic knowledge, should also be knowledgeable of the working, instruments, and conventions of financial markets that range from Foreign Exchange to Equities, Bonds, Commodities, Cryptocurrencies and host of other asset classes. The objective of this course is to provide Data Science students with a working knowledge of major areas of finance that could help them in finding a position in the Financial Industry. The wide range of topics covered in this course besides expanding the range of positions where students could be a fit, it gives them more flexibility in their job search. The course will also be of value to them in managing their own finances in the future.

TOPICS IN QUANT FINANCE
IEOR4721E
1

This graduate-level course provides a rigorous foundation in quantitative portfolio construction, bridging theory with practical implementation. It develops a systematic framework for constructing optimal portfolios, beginning with the classical Markowitz model and enhancing it to address real-world portfolio objectives and constraints.  Students learn how  forecasts of asset returns, risk, and market impact are formulated in the  optimizer objectives and constraints, and how estimation error affects portfolio construction and performance. They also study the robust estimation of key optimizer inputs such as risk models using modern statistical and econometric methods that handle noise and time-varying dynamics. Students gain hands-on experience constructing portfolios using industry-standard datasets, tools, and risk models. The course also provides a brief introduction to advanced topics such as random matrix theory, multiperiod optimization, and the use of modern machine learning methods, which represent emerging directions in quantitative portfolio research.

TOPICS IN QUANTITATIVE FINANCE
IEOR4728E
1

The search for better performance has led investors to explore Alternative Investments that are outside the traditional categories of exchange traded equities, Treasury Bonds, and other
investment-grade fixed income products. The field of Alternative Investments covers a wide range of products such as convertible bonds, Preferred Shares, Hedge Funds, Venture Capital, and
Cryptocurrencies. There is a growing need in the market for students with knowledge of these products and the practical and theoretical know how of valuing and risk managing these investments given that each product has it own nuances and anomalies. This course presents and studies some major Alternative Investment products and ways to evaluate and risk manage them.

Team-based iterative design sequence to create a novel invention made to meet a well-defined need.  Students will identify a need through research, develop a novel (in a patent sense) solution, create a proof-of-concept low-fidelity prototype, and finally create a refined prototype.  Students will utilize theory, simulation, and experimentation to validate key design choices.  The course will include ideation techniques, intellectual property, standards, advanced 3D modeling, rapid prototyping, kinematics, dynamic simulation, finite element analysis, optimization, and experimental design.

FOUNDATIONS OF DATA SCIENCE
ORCA2500E
1

Designed to provide an introduction to data science for sophomore SEAS majors. Combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world applications. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? Teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming, statistical inference, and machine learning, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets such as economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. At least one project will address a problem relevant to New York City.
